\section{X-ray detectors }

The EUV has been studied some what but a lot more literature
exists on X-ray detectors. While soft X-rays may be somewhat
similar to EUV, even the harder X-rays will explore relevant
part of the materials including core electrons that may 
ignored in lower energy studies. This may be important as
core electrons and relativistic effects have recently been shown
to be important contributors to the potential of the lead
acid battery and liely effect EUV resist physics and cheisty.

Halide perovskites are one class of X-ray detector
with a recent interest in lead-free versions
\cite{doi:10.1021/acsaom.4c00265}.
