While silver halide literature for nm scale patterning is scarce,
there is experience with some pieces. For example, submircon silver
clutsters were formed in a mixture of silver and PMMA
\cite{PMC4820741}.


AgBr captures the "hole" to make Br and Ag both neutrals and the
hole can escape as a gas. 

One step in the cluster formation may involve atom migration.
The relevance to dark "current" or exposure needs to be considered
but also any relevance of the primary EUv energy on related
processes.

While diffusion seems to be inescapable part of photoresist mechanism
ion or atom aggregatopm does not seem motivated although it
is central to the notions of silver halide latent image formation.
