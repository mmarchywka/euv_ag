Bimolecular recomination for example,

\mjmeqn{ \mjmdt{A} = A-A^2}

you can guess something like
\mjmeqn{A=\frac{1}{t+f} }
and get
\mjmeqn{\mjmdt{f}=-(t+f) }
which can be solved with an integrating factor
giving
\mjmeqn{A=\frac{1}{1+Ce^{-t}} }

actually better was partial fractions ,

\mjmeqn{ \frac{dA}{A(1-A)} = dt }
leading to same results doh.
