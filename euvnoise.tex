\begin{abstract}
EUV lithography appears to be optimal for just about everything to
go wrong. The appeal of high resultion from the short wavelengths
has been difficult to realize for economical production of 
complicated integrated circuits. Nominally "linear" real space
imaging ignores a large number of easy ways to improve
patterning using a photoresist with multi-photon dynamics.
While this term seems to be associated with virtual intermediate
states, it has been used to describe silver halide mechanisms
, with long lived real states, for decades. 
A number of systems exist for things like photon up-conversion
for example
\cite{D5CP00333D}.
This work first reviews some simply possible multi-photon processes
and their characteristic or D-log-E curves. One objectives is to
get binary images with good latitude and this curve helps define that
property. Another concern with EUV is the light quantization, often
refered to as "stochastics' that cause fluctuations in exposure
and noise in the developed pattern.  A brief consideration of multi-photon
effects on fluctuations and resolution is included.  
Much of this work is on the properties of silver halides that
may be useful in an EUV resist but its worth nothing that some
properties are also central to things like battery design.
Besides the multi-photon resist specific additional areas
are noted for further consideration. Inclusion of a mobile
nucleus to form developable clusters for example.
In the near death experience that is EUV litho, "move towards
the light" seems apropos lol. 
The grains common in silver halide films are too coarse for nm
scale patterning but the concept of a pixelated resist,
with nm size squares devloping all-or-nothing, 
may be useful to consider further.

\section{Introduction  }

EUV lithography is complicated by a number of issues with the
photon energy and consequent physics and chemistry.
At 13.5nm, the photon energy of 92 eV is well above chemical
reaction thresholds and single absorption event generates
an electron and hole cloud as the initial hot carriers thermalize.
With typical exposure doses of 1mJ/cm2, this translates into only 
.7photos/nm2 but this is an average with fluctuations described by
Poisson statistics for an uncorrelated light source. In the literature
this quantization issue is often described as "stochastics."
\cite{Denbeaux_Azhari_Ai_Understanding_onset_}a
\cite{Mack_Stochastic_limitations_2018}
  The electron 
cloud may include emission into the vacuum and there is also residual gas
excited by photons and secondary electrons to consider.
As far as the chemistry goes, common organic photoresists
will produce vapors that are as bad as any contaminant complicating
EUV optical systems. 

One important manifestations of the quantization of stochastics
issue is "line edge roughness" (LER). This has been discussed
in many ways including gross measures such as standard deviation
or in more details exploring the frequency distribution of lithography
and etch properties \cite{Mack_Reducing_roughness_extreme_2018}.
One focus of this work on multi-photon processes concerns
a curve derived from uniform illumination which may seem irrelevant to 
idealized step desired in a final device structure at an edge.
However, in real life illumination patterns have significant transition
regions and if the curves are not step functions with light dose
then there can be noise in the intermediate cases. 




The focus of this work is on multi-photon processes for better
use of the highly quantized light. Existing literature labelled
as multi-photon for lithography apparently is specialized to 
 high intensity lasers pumping into
virtual states requiring simultaneous photons and therefore a high
flux that is usually direct write scanned rather than masked
\cite{Zuev_Nguyen_Putlyaev_printing_bioprinting_2020}
\cite{Ritschdorff_Nielson_Shear_Multi_focal_multiphoton_lithography_2012}
\cite{Guan_Cao_Liu_Light_matter_2024}
. 
The latter reference \cite{Guan_Cao_Liu_Light_matter_2024}
discusses some multi-photon resist systems designed for
maskless lithography and the achievement of sub-diffration
$\lambda /14.8$ critical dimension although some of these concept
may already be implemented in multi-trigger resists
designed for masked ( achieveable flux density ) EUV lithoggrapy.
Recently however some work has noted the problem suggesitng the 
use of real, long lived states and mentioning litrhography
as a potential application \cite{2025arXiv250118706W}
.

The mechanisms described here are most closely related
to multi-trigger resists. In reality the reactions will be 
related to carriers more directly than photons and the 
terminology is a bit moot. 

Multi-photon processes have been recognized for a long time as a way
to improve resolution beyond what may be achievable from linear
processes at a given wavelength. Significant detailed works exist
on rate equations and interaction of the different processes that
can occur. 

 
In the EUV, control of fluctuations has been recognized as another 
important benefit and the literature on multi-trigger resists
addresses this. 

As no immediate solution appears to be completely supoerioer to the others
or entirely satisfactory, this work goes through the rate equations
for simplistic model equations motivating what may be expected from
candidate systems. 

Among the resist chemistries explored, metal oxides have been considered.
However, there does not appear to be any serious consideration of the
well known silver halide chemistry. This historical system is considered
to illustrate some issues although it may not be adaptible to EUV.
Silver halides, despite their wide range of apliations, do not appear to have much usage in the nm resolution range with ultra-fine grain dimensions  being in the 35-50 nm range \cite{Kuge_Morimoto_Sensitization_ultra_fine_2017}.
However, the goal of this work is to look at the mechanisms and determine
if any of these are worth consideration for a possible new design.


Resists, like film, can be characterized by a curve relating exposure
conditions to ultimate result after developing. 
Film often used the "D-log-E" curve relating the optical density of the
final result to the integrated light dose at any point. Resists may 
be evaluated with many such functions such as thickness versus 
total energy dose ( usually mJ/cm2).  This work will consider generic
rate equations initially and use terms like "D-log-E" as a generic
or non-specific term for characteristic curve.  
In many imaging applications, linearity is desired. This is most easily achieved with one photon processes. In the case of lithography with a binary
outcome, a sharp high-contrast sigmoidal curve is usually beneficial. 
Or as it has been said, 
" Higher contrasts lead to
higher resolution in general and the resolution is the Holy Grail of microlithography" \cite{Ito_Chemical_Amplification_Resists_2005}.

The intial discussion will try to find systems that generate sharp
high contrast D-log-E curves wihle making best use of limited light
and avoiding noise due to fluctuations.

The term sensitometric curve has also been used \cite{Zhu_Yoo_Jursinic_Characteristics_sensitometric_curves_2003}.

Contrast curve along with the term gamma for the slope in the transition
region may also be used \cite{Ito_Chemical_Amplification_Resists_2005}.

\section{ Statement of Conflicts }
 No specific funding was used in this effort and there are no relationships
with others that could create a conflict of interest. I would like to develop
these ideas further and have obvious bias towards making them appear 
successful. Barbara Cade, the dog owner, has worked in the pet food industry
but this does not likely create a conflict. We have no interest in the
makers of any of the products named in this work.

\section{About the Authors and Facility}
This work was performed at a dog rescue run by Barbara Cade and
housed in rural Georgia.  The author of this report 
,Mike Marchywka,
has a background in electrical engineering and 
has done extensive research using free online literature sources.  
I hope to find additional people interested in critically 
examining the results and verify that they can be reproduced
effectively to treat other dogs.
