abstract = {Silver halides are notable for exhibiting both ionic and electronic conductivity which is responsible for their widespread use in photography. Due to differences in ionicity and bonding, their properties vary from the highly ionic silver fluoride to the more covalent silver iodide. These fundamental properties such as defect formation energies, carrier mobilities and band-structures, particularly of silver iodide, have only recently been determined. One interesting finding is the presence of high surface fields, caused by differences between interstitial and vacancy formation energies, which results in separation of photo-generated electron hole pairs. This throws new light on the photographic process and on the suitability of silver bromide as a photographic material.a-AgI is also the first fast ion conductor to be discovered. Structural instability, low defect formation energy and optimum cation size are responsible for this phenomenon but existing models fail to explain all the experimental results. Recent microwave conductivity and neutron scattering experiments which provide fresh insight are discussed.},

abstract = {<jats:p>Since their first use about 150 years ago, silver halides have remained the primary photosensing materials in an image capturing process known as photography. Silver halides have retained their pre-eminent role despite numerous attempts to replace them with other materials. Even in the present era of electronics, conventional photography remains the most popular format for recording still images. When compared with electronic imaging, silver halide photography retains an edge in resolution, latitude, and convenience.</jats:p><jats:p>The current superiority and popularity of conventional photography stem from an unusual confluence of properties found in the silver halides. The ensuing articles will discuss the properties that make silver halides particularly well suited for photography. The article by L.M. Slifkin discusses the improbability of any one material having the characteristics of the silver halides. F.C. Brown describes the special electronic properties, and P.W.M. Jacobs covers ionic characteristics. C.R.A. Catlow gives us some insight into the nature of the silver halides based on their interatomic potentials. This introductory article presents an overview of the photographic process.</jats:p><jats:p>The theory of the photographic process has its roots in the Gurney-Mott model of latent image formation. Since it was first proposed over 50 years ago, this model has formed the basis of mechanistic thinking about photography.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>The ability of chemically amplified resists to transfer an aerial image at increasingly smaller dimensions is critical to EUV lithography success at increasingly smaller process nodes [Bisschop and Hendrickx, <jats:italic>Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography X</jats:italic> (SPIE) <jats:bold>10957</jats:bold> 37 (2019)]. Stochastic inhomogeneities in resist exposure and patterning have been studied, which include photon shot noise and resist surface roughness. However, previous work has indicated that inhomogeneities and defectivity are present in multicomponent resists beyond those predicted by random statistics [Jablonski et al. (Santa Clara, CA) p. 302 (2004); Woodward et al. <jats:italic>Advances in Resist Materials and Processing Technology XXIV</jats:italic> (SPIE) <jats:bold>6519</jats:bold> 416 (2007); Fedynyshyn et al. <jats:italic>Advances in Resist Technology and Processing XXIII</jats:italic> (SPIE) <jats:bold>6153</jats:bold> 387 (2006); Fedynyshyn et al. <jats:italic>J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B</jats:italic>, <jats:bold>24</jats:bold>, 3031 (2006); Kohyama et al. <jats:italic>Advances in Patterning Materials and Processes XXXVI</jats:italic> (SPIE) <jats:bold>10960</jats:bold> 218 (2019)]. This is thought to be due to self-segregation of components in the multi-component chemically amplified resist. The results in this paper show that the most critical part of the resist chemical segregation occurs during the spin coating process after a significant amount of the solvent has evaporated, but while there is still enough solvent to enable molecular mobility within the resist.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Demands for micro and nanofabrication techniques have been increasing over recent decades due to their foundational importance in fields such as electronics, sensors, displays, biotechnologies, and energy technologies. Still, the rapid and efficient fabrication of complex 3D microstructures has long been a challenge due to the inherent limitations of conventional imprint lithography and the slow fabrication speed of maskless lithography systems using femtosecond lasers. This study introduces a novel lithographic replication method for the rapid replication of intricate 3D microstructures with closedloops by leveraging the Poisson effectdriven lateral deformation of soft molds. Specifically, the suggested technique employs an elastomeric soft mold, engraved with negative cavity parts of the target structure separated by intentional gaps. Lateral deformation of the material allows the separated cavities to assemble for replication of target microstructure and defectless release from the soft mold. In addition to the experimental demonstrations of the proposed method using wellknown materials like polydimethysliloxane (PDMS) for the soft mold and UVcurable polyurethane acrylate (PUA) for replication, essential considerations such as material selection and master mold design are discussed. The presented method not only broadens the capabilities of imprint lithographic techniques but also holds promise for the large scale, continuous fabrication of complex 3D microstructures.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>For higher computing power of semiconductor integrated circuits, pattern feature sizes below 10nm are anticipated by introducing extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography with high numerical aperture (NA) optics. However, performances of EUV resist processes are not commensurate with its imaging capability or that for its deep UV predecessor. We regard resist processes as a series of chemo-physical events and examine their statistical nature, which bridges chemo-physics and lithography performances. The relationships between statistical characteristics and lithography performances are investigated by first-principle Monte Carlo simulations. We further describe a whole pattern formation as a directional network spatially and hierarchically connecting chemo-physical events. It clarifies that the contrast between exposed and unexposed areas and spatial correlations in event distributions increase with the proceeding event steps from photon absorptions to molecular dissolutions, achieving molecular order precision and high resolution. This is attributed to the averaging effect of multi-photon-induced molecular solubility switching and collaborative molecular dissolutions. Their effectiveness, however, decrease as the pattern size shrinks with changing the exposure systems from deep ultraviolet to high-NA EUV, degrading material-inherent resolution capability and increasing stochasticity. This is because of sparse photon absorptions, localized secondary electron generations, and molecular interaction ranges approaching the pattern sizes. The directional network models using the hierarchical stack of binomial, beta-binomial distributions, and mixed Bernoulli convolution well describe the behaviors of EUV-exposed nanopatterns, opening a path to fully statistical lithography simulations. Controlling the statistical nature is crucial in pushing the EUV resolution down below 10nm.</jats:p>},

While the 6F2 architecture had the concern of the shrinking gap between bit line and storage node contact (https://lnkd.in/guCU7Dwe), the 4F2 architecture would have a similar risk of the closing gap between adjacent word lines, especially for aiming to achieve equivalent 10nm (6F2) density and beyond. 4F2 therefore does not appear to be viable in the long term either. 3D (>100 layers) should be considered as the next option.

abstract = {Sensitized triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (sTTA-UC) converts two lower-energy absorbed photons into one emitting photon of higher-energy{,} and has become a popular approach for a wide range of applications. Current photosensitizers rely mostly on transition metal complexes made of expensive platinum group elements{,} such as palladium{,} platinum{,} and osmium{,} due to their strong absorption in the visible range{,} unity intersystem crossing{,} and long-lived triplet excited lifetimes. In recent years{,} fundamental breakthroughs have been made with photoactive complexes based on earth-abundant 3d metals including chromium{,} manganese{,} iron{,} cobalt{,} copper{,} and zinc{,} and 4d elements like zirconium and molybdenum. These novel complexes offer advantages{,} such as cost-effectiveness{,} sustainability{,} low toxicity{,} scalability for industrial use{,} and potential for innovative research in areas including catalysis and energy conversion{,} making them promising alternatives to noble metal-based photosensitizers in sTTA-UC and other fields. In this review{,} we delineate the recent advancements in sTTA-UC utilizing photoactive earth-abundant transition metal complexes. We explore their energy transfer mechanisms{,} evaluate their upconversion performance{,} discuss their applications{,} and outline the challenges and perspectives{,} aiming to offer insights for the development of novel photosensitizers based on earth-abundant metals for future research and applications.},

abstract = {Abstract Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has enabled significant reductions in device dimensions but is often limited by capillary force-driven pattern collapse in conventional wet processes. Recent dry-development approaches, while promising, frequently require toxic etchants or specialized equipment, limiting their broader applicability and highlighting the need for more sustainable, cost-effective alternatives. In this study, highly reactive, etchant-free dry-developable EUV photoresists using N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-based metal-ligand complexes, achieving half-saturation at EUV doses of 8.5 or 27 mJ cmminus2, are synthesized. A simple thermal dry development process is employed, utilizing a standard furnace to remove unexposed areas of the photoresist, leading to 80\NBSPnm resolution with line-edge roughness (LER) comparable to wet-developed patterns. Moreover, EUV-induced chemical reactions of the NHC metal-ligand complexes are investigated via EUV-photoelectron spectroscopy, near-edge X-ray absorption fine structures, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory. It is suggested that the high EUV sensitivity of the NHC metal-ligand complexes is attributed to branching polymerization reactions initiated by secondary electron and photoelectron generation. These EUV-sensitive, dry-developable NHC metal-organic photoresists offer a sustainable and economical alternative to conventional techniques, eliminating the need for toxic and corrosive etchants while achieving high-resolution nanopatterns through simple thermal treatment, thus advancing future nanofabrication technologies.},

Moreover, EUV-induced chemical reactions of the NHC metal-ligand complexes are investigated via EUV-photoelectron spectroscopy, near-edge X-ray absorption fine structures, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory. It is suggested that the high EUV sensitivity of the NHC metal-ligand complexes is attributed to branching polymerization reactions initiated by secondary electron and photoelectron generation. These EUV-sensitive, dry-developable NHC metalorganic photoresists offer a sustainable and economical alternative to conventional techniques, eliminating the need for toxic and corrosive etchants while achieving high-resolution nanopatterns through simple thermal treatment, thus advancing future nanofabrication technologies.},

abstract = {Noble metal nanoclusters are ultrasmall nanomaterials with tunable properties and huge application potential; however, retaining their enhanced functionality is difficult as they readily lose their properties without stabilization. Here, we demonstrate a facile synthesis of highly photostable silver nanoclusters in a polymer thin film using visible light photoreduction. Furthermore, the different stages of the nanocluster formation are investigated in detail using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. A cost-effective fabrication of photostable micron-sized fluorescent silver nanocluster barcode is demonstrated in silver-impregnated polymer films using a low-power continuous-wave laser diode. It is shown that a laser power of as low as 0.75mW is enough to write fluorescent structures, corresponding to the specifications of a commercially available laser pointer. The as-formed nanocluster-containing microstructures can be useful in direct labeling applications such as authenticity marking and fluorescent labeling.},

abstract = {Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) is a leading technology in semiconductor manufacturing, enabling the creation of high-resolution patterns essential for advanced microelectronics. This review highlights recent progress in inorganic metal-oxide-based photoresists, with a focus on their applications in EUVL. The unique properties of zinc-based, tin-oxygen, and IVB group inorganic photoresists are examined, showcasing their enhanced chemical reactivity and precise patterning capabilities. Key advancements include the development of zinc oxide and tin oxide nanoparticles, which demonstrate significant improvements in photon absorption and solubility under extreme ultraviolet exposure. Additionally, the review delves into the photochemical reactions of tin-oxygen clusters and the influence of various ligands on film density and cross-linking. The findings suggest that these inorganic photoresists not only improve photolithographic performance but also hold potential for broader applications, such as pyroelectric infrared sensors and 3D printing. Future research directions are outlined, including the optimization of process parameters, the exploration of new ligand and metal combinations, and the evaluation of the environmental benefits of inorganic photoresists over traditional organic ones. These advancements are poised to further enhance the resolution and patterning capabilities required for next-generation semiconductor devices.},
