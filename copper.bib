abstract = {<jats:p>Senile plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer disease (AD) are primarily composed of the amyloidupbeta (Aupbeta) peptide and contain substantially elevated levels of iron, copper and zinc. These metals bind to Aupbeta and have been reported to increase the toxicity of Aupbeta to cultured neurones. Other reports have demonstrated that Aupbeta can reduce the neurotoxicity of metal ions, suggesting that the interaction can, under some circumstances, be protective. To investigate these apparently conflicting results, human Aupbetai42 was coinjected with iron, copper or zinc (at the concentrations found in plaques) into rat cerebral cortex, and the resulting numbers of dying neurones were compared. It was found that Aupbeta complexed with either iron or zinc was more toxic than Aupbeta alone. In contrast, Aupbetacopper complexes were not neurotoxic. Surprisingly, we observed that when iron or copper were combined with Aupbeta, the neurotoxicity of these metals was substantially reduced, suggesting that Aupbeta may help to limit the toxicity of redoxactive metal ions, thereby assisting the antioxidant defence of the brain. Thus paradoxical effects occur when AP complexes with metal ions, where Aupbetametal complexes are capable of being neurotoxic and neuroprotective.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<p>Neurodegenerative diseases are prevalent and currently incurable conditions that progressively impair cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric functions of the central or peripheral nervous system. Fibrinogen, a macromolecular glycoprotein, plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response and tissue repair in the human body and interacts with various nervous system cells due to its unique molecular structure. Accumulating evidence suggests that fibrinogen deposits in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. By regulating pathophysiological mechanisms and signaling pathways, fibrinogen can exacerbate the neuro-pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases, while depletion of fibrinogen contributes to the amelioration of cognitive function impairment in patients. This review comprehensively summarizes the molecular mechanisms and biological functions of fibrinogen in central nervous system cells and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Vascular dementia, Huntington's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Additionally, we discuss the potential of fibrinogen-related treatments in the management of neurodegenerative disorders.</p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A recent study by Rackaityte et al. reported evidence for a low level of bacterial colonization, specifically of <jats:italic>Micrococcus luteus</jats:italic>, in the intestine of second trimester human fetuses. We have re-analyzed their sequence data and identified a batch effect which violates the underlying assumptions of the bioinformatic method used for contamination removal. This batch effect resulted in <jats:italic>Micrococcus</jats:italic> not being identified as a contaminant in the original work and being falsely assigned to the fetal samples. We further provide evidence that the micrographs presented by Rackaityte et al. are unlikely to show Micrococci or other bacteria as the size of the particles shown exceeds that of related bacterial cells. Finally, phylogenetic analysis showed that the microbes cultured from the fetal samples differed significantly from those detected by sequencing. Overall, our findings show that the presence of <jats:italic>Micrococcus</jats:italic> in the fetal gut is not supported by the primary sequence data. Our findings underline important aspects of the nature of contamination for both sequencing and culture approaches in microbiome studies and the appropriate use of automated contamination identification tools.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a member of the APP family of proteins, and different enzymatic processing leads to the production of several derivatives that are shown to have distinct biological functions. APP is involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder causing dementia. Furthermore, it is believed that individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have increased APP expression, due to an extra copy of chromosome 21 (Hsa21), that contains the gene for APP. Nevertheless, the physiological function of APP remains unclear. It is known that APP plays an important role in neural growth and maturation during brain development, possibly by influencing proliferation, cell fate specification and neurogenesis of neural stem cells (NSCs). Proteolytic cleavage of APP occurs mainly via two mutually exclusive pathways, the non-amyloidogenic pathway or the amyloidogenic pathway. Other alternative pathways ($\eta$-secretase, $\delta$-secretase and meprin pathways) have also been described for the physiological processing of APP. The different metabolites generated from these pathways, including soluble APP$\alpha$ (sAPP$\alpha$), soluble APP$\beta$ (sAPP$\beta$), $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) peptides and the APP intracellular domain (AICD), have different functions determined by their structural differences, equilibrium and concentration with respect to other fragments derived from APP. This review discusses recent observations regarding possible functions of APP and its proteolytic derivatives in the biology and phenotypic specification of NSCs. This can be important for a better understanding of the pathogenesis and the development of future therapeutic applications for AD and/or DS, diseases in which alterations in neurogenesis have been described.},

abstract = {<jats:p>Amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been widely studied due to its association with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the physiological functions of APP are still largely unexplored. APP is a transmembrane glycoprotein whose expression in humans is abundant in the central nervous system. Specifically, several studies have revealed the high expression of APP during brain development. Previous studies in our laboratory revealed that a transient increase in APP expression induces early cell cycle exit of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) and directs their differentiation towards glial cells (gliogenesis) while decreasing their differentiation towards neurons (neurogenesis). In the present study, we have evaluated the intrinsic cellular effects of APP down-expression (using siRNA) on cell death, cell proliferation, and cell fate specification of hNSCs. Our data indicate that APP silencing causes cellular effects opposite to those obtained in previous APP overexpression assays, inducing cell proliferation in hNS1 cells (a model line of hNSCs) and favoring neurogenesis instead of gliogenesis in these cells. In addition, we have analyzed the gene and protein expression levels of upbeta-Catenin as a possible molecule involved in these cellular effects. These data could help to understand the biological role of APP, which is necessary to deepen the knowledge of AD.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Neurogenesis in the developing human cerebral cortex occurs at a particularly slow rate owing in part to cortical neural progenitors preserving their progenitor state for a relatively long time, while generating neurons. How this balance between the progenitor and neurogenic state is regulated, and whether it contributes to species-specific brain temporal patterning, is poorly understood. Here, we show that the characteristic potential of human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to remain in a progenitor state as they generate neurons for a prolonged amount of time requires the amyloid precursor protein (APP). In contrast, APP is dispensable in mouse NPCs, which undergo neurogenesis at a much faster rate. Mechanistically, APP cell-autonomously contributes to protracted neurogenesis through suppression of the proneurogenic activator protein-1 transcription factor and facilitation of canonical WNT signaling. We propose that the fine balance between self-renewal and differentiation is homeostatically regulated by APP, which may contribute to human-specific temporal patterns of neurogenesis.</jats:p>},

abstract = {The physiological actions of orally ingested peptides on the brain remain poorly understood. This study examined the effects of 39 orally administered synthetic Tyr-containing dipeptides on the enhancement of brain norepinephrine metabolism in mice by comparing the concentration of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MHPG). Although Tyr-Tyr administration increased blood and cerebral cortex (Cx) Tyr concentrations the most, Tyr-Trp increased Cx MHPG concentration the most. The oral administration of Tyr-Trp ameliorated a short-term memory deficit of a mouse model of cognitive dysfunction induced by amyloid beta peptide 25-35. Gene expression profiling of mouse brain using a microarray indicated that Tyr-Trp administration led to a wide variety of changes in mRNA levels, including the upregulation of genes encoding molecules involved in catecholamine metabolism. A comparative metabolome analysis of the Cx of mice given Tyr-Trp or Tyr-Tyr demonstrated that Tyr-Trp administration yielded higher concentrations of Trp and kynurenine pathway metabolites than Tyr-Tyr administration, as well as higher L-dopa levels, which is the initial product of catecholamine metabolism. Catecholamines were not significantly increased in the Cx of the Tyr-Tyr group compared with the Tyr-Trp group, despite a marked increase in Tyr. Presumably, Tyr-Trp administration enhances catecholamine synthesis and metabolism via the upregulation of genes involved in Tyr and Trp metabolism as well as metabolites of Tyr and Trp. These findings strongly suggest that orally ingested Tyr-Trp modulates the brain metabolome involved in catecholamine metabolism and contributes to higher brain function.},

abstract = {<jats:p>Besides its role in coagulation, vitamin K seems to be involved in various other mechanisms, including inflammation and age-related diseases, also at the level of gene expression. This work examined the roles of two vitamin K2 (menaquinones) vitamers, namely, menaquinone-4 (MK4) and reduced menaquinone-7 (MK7R), as gene modulator compounds, as well as their potential role in the epigenetic regulation of genes involved in amyloidogenesis and neuroinflammation. The SK-N-BE human neuroblastoma cells provided a Ux201c[bad char  vv=8220]first-lineUx201d[bad char  vv=8221] model for screening the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative molecular pathways. MK7R, being a new vitamin K form, was first tested in terms of solubilization, uptake and cell viability, together with MK4 as an endogenous control. We assessed the expression of key factors in amyloidogenesis and neuroinflammation, observing that the MK7R treatment was associated with the downregulation of neurodegeneration- (PSEN1 and BACE1) and neuroinflammation- (IL-1upbeta and IL-6) associated genes, whereas genes retaining protective roles toward amiloidogenesis were upregulated (ADAM10 and ADAM17). By profiling the DNA methylation patterns of genes known to be epigenetically regulated, we observed a correlation between hypermethylation and the downregulation of PSEN1, IL-1upbeta and IL-6. These results suggest a possible role of MK7R in the treatment of cognitive impairment, giving a possible base for further preclinical experiments in animal models of neurodegenerative disease.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title> <jats:p>In mammals, copper (Cu) absorption occurs mostly in the small intestine, and some of the Cu transporters involved in its uptake have been characterised. In fish, however, the regions of the gut involved in Cu absorption and the membrane transport mechanisms responsible for gastrointestinal Cu uptake are unknown. Everted gut sacs and isolated perfused intestine of Clarias gariepinus were used to explore Cu absorption (at 22 \textdegreeC). Gut sacs exposed to 100 upmumol lminus1mucosal solution Cu ([Cu]m) showed that Cu was mostly (70 %) absorbed in the middle and hind intestine. Most of the accumulated Cu was located in the mucosa. In perfused intestines, cumulative Cu absorption from the mucosal solution to the serosal perfusate was greatest at 10 upmumol lminus1[Cu]m and decreased at higher values of [Cu]m, while tissue accumulation of Cu showed a dose-dependent elevation. Absorption efficiency therefore declined with increasing Cu dose, and basolateral transport was the limiting factor in Cu uptake. Serosal applications of the P-type ATPase inhibitor vanadate (100 upmumol lminus1) or the anion transport inhibitor DIDS (100 upmumol lminus1) caused threefold increases in net Cu uptake (at [Cu]m=10 upmumol lminus1). The vanadate effect was explained by a reduction in transepithelial potential rather than inhibition of Cu-ATPase, but the DIDS effect was not. Transepithelial potential, water transport and tissue [Cu] were not affected by DIDS, but tissue [K+] was elevated. Removal of Clminussimultaneously from both the mucosal and serosal solutions caused a 10-fold reduction in the rate of Cu uptake, while removal of Clminusfrom the mucosal solution only completely abolished Cu absorption to the serosal perfusate. Transepithelial potential effects are discussed. We conclude that Cu absorption occurs mostly in the intestine and is normally driven by a basolateral Cu/anion symport that prefers Clminus.</jats:p>},

description = {The article looks at the basic mechanisms of anemia in patients with liver cirrhosis (bleeding through esophageal varices, hemorrhoids, vascular fragility, hypertensive portal gastropathy, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, vitamin K deficiency, splenic rupture, splenic sequestration of red blood cells in splenomegaly) and also the additional mechanisms of anemia in liver cirrhosis (erythropoietin deficiency, renal injury, chronic inflammation, deficiency of trace elements and vitamins, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, Zieve syndrome). Depending on the Child-Pugh staging of liver cirrhosis, as well as the associated pathologies of the patient with liver cirrhosis, it is possible that there are simultaneously several ways of the appearance of anemia. It is an attempt to achieve more than a simple review of them in a tabular form, focusing not only on physiopathology, but also on diagnostic and therapeutic elements - the latter being briefly mentioned in widely known situations and presented in more detail in the context of the rarer causes of anemia in patients with liver cirrhosis. In conclusion, the differential and positive diagnosis of anemia in liver cirrhosis decisively influences the therapeutic decision and, of course, not only survival, but also the patient's quality of life. Interdisciplinary collaboration (family doctor, gastroenterologist, internist, infectious disease specialist, hematologist, surgeon, ICA, medical imaging, laboratory) is the optimal way to a diagnosis and targeted treatment of the causes of anemia in liver cirrhosis.},

abstract = {Copper (Cu) in its ionic forms is an essential element for mammals and its homeostasis is tightly controlled. Accordingly{,} Cu-dyshomeostasis can be lethal as is the case in the well-established genetic Wilson{'}s and Menkes diseases. In Alzheimer{'}s disease (AD){,} Cu-accumulation occurs in amyloid plaques{,} where it is bound to the amyloid-beta peptide (Aupbeta). In vitro{,} Cu-Aupbeta is competent to catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of ascorbate under aerobic conditions{,} and hence Cu-Aupbeta is believed to contribute to the oxidative stress in AD. Several molecules that can recover extracellular Cu from Aupbeta and transport it back into cells with beneficial effects in cell culture and transgenic AD models were identified. However{,} all the Cu-shuttles currently available are not satisfactory due to various potential limitations including ion selectivity and toxicity. Hence{,} we designed a novel peptide-based Cu shuttle with the following properties: (i) it contains a Cu(ii)-binding motif that is very selective to Cu(ii) over all other essential metal ions; (ii) it is tagged with a fluorophore sensitive to Cu(ii)-binding and release; (iii) it is made of a peptide platform{,} which is very versatile to add new functions. The work presented here reports on the characterization of AKH-upalphaR5W4NBD{,} which is able to transport Cu ions selectively into PC12 cells and the imported Cu appeared bioavailable{,} likely via reductive release induced by glutathione.

abstract_as_rcvd = {Copper (Cu) in its ionic forms is an essential element for mammals and its homeostasis is tightly controlled. Accordingly{,} Cu-dyshomeostasis can be lethal as is the case in the well-established genetic Wilson{'}s and Menkes diseases. In Alzheimer{'}s disease (AD){,} Cu-accumulation occurs in amyloid plaques{,} where it is bound to the amyloid-beta peptide (AŒ≤). In vitro{,} CuÄìAŒ≤ is competent to catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of ascorbate under aerobic conditions{,} and hence CuÄìAŒ≤ is believed to contribute to the oxidative stress in AD. Several molecules that can recover extracellular Cu from AŒ≤ and transport it back into cells with beneficial effects in cell culture and transgenic AD models were identified. However{,} all the Cu-shuttles currently available are not satisfactory due to various potential limitations including ion selectivity and toxicity. Hence{,} we designed a novel peptide-based Cu shuttle with the following properties: (i) it contains a Cu(ii)-binding motif that is very selective to Cu(ii) over all other essential metal ions; (ii) it is tagged with a fluorophore sensitive to Cu(ii)-binding and release; (iii) it is made of a peptide platform{,} which is very versatile to add new functions. The work presented here reports on the characterization of AKH-ŒR5W4NBD{,} which is able to transport Cu ions selectively into PC12 cells and the imported Cu appeared bioavailable{,} likely via reductive release induced by glutathione. Moreover{,} AKH-ŒR5W4NBD was able to withdraw Cu from the AŒ≤1Äì16 peptide and consequently inhibited the Cu-AŒ≤ based reactive oxygen species production and related cell toxicity. Hence{,} AKH-ŒR5W4NBD could be a valuable new tool for Cu-transport into cells and suitable for mechanistic studies in cell culture{,} with potential applications in restoring Cu-homeostasis in Cu-related diseases such as AD.},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>The classical deficiency diseases have nearly disappeared from the industrialised world and are thought to be found largely in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. More than 80 collected medical articles, mostly from Europe and North America, describe more than 9000 people with low concentrations of copper in organs or tissues or impaired metabolic pathways dependent on copper. More than a dozen articles reveal improved anatomy, chemistry or physiology in more than 1000 patients from supplements containing copper. These criteria are diagnostic of deficiency according to The Oxford Textbook of Medicine. Alzheimer's disease, ischaemic heart disease and osteoporosis receive major emphasis here. However, impaired vision, myelodysplastic syndrome and peripheral neuropathy are mentioned. Copper deficiency probably causes some common, contemporaneous diseases. Advice is provided about opportunities for research. Seemingly authoritative statements concerning the rarity of nutritional deficiency in developed countries are wrong.</jats:p>},

abstract = {The Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and its homologues are transmembrane proteins required for various aspects of neuronal development and activity, whose molecular function is unknown. Specifically, it is unclear whether APP acts as a receptor, and if so what its ligand(s) may be. We show that APP binds the Wnt ligands Wnt3a and Wnt5a and that this binding regulates APP protein levels. Wnt3a binding promotes full-length APP (flAPP) recycling and stability. In contrast, Wnt5a promotes APP targeting to lysosomal compartments and reduces flAPP levels. A conserved Cysteine-Rich Domain (CRD) in the extracellular portion of APP is required for Wnt binding, and deletion of the CRD abrogates the effects of Wnts on flAPP levels and trafficking. Finally, loss of APP results in increased axonal and reduced dendritic growth of mouse embryonic primary cortical neurons. This phenotype can be cell-autonomously rescued by full length, but not CRD-deleted, APP and regulated by Wnt ligands in a CRD-dependent manner.},

The results indicated that exposure to 6 mg/l Cu for 72 h induced the production of reactive oxygen species, thereby increasing protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation in enterocytes of grass carp <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>. Cells exposed to Cu alone resulted in a significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase release, which is accompanied by depletions of antioxidants, including total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), anti-superoxide anion (ASA), anti-hydroxy radical (AHR) activities and GSH content. Pre-treatment with Glu remarkably prevented the toxic effects of Cu on the T-SOD, GST, GR, AHR, and ASA activities and GSH content in enterocytes. However, Cu induced an adaptive increase in the activities of catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Glu supplementation further increased GPx activity in enterocytes. Interestingly, the experiment <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> showed that Glu pre-supplementation significantly elevated SOD, GPx, GST, GR, ASA and AHR activities, as well as GSH content. Further results showed that pre-treatment with Glu could alleviate Cu-induced oxidative injury by elevating antioxidant enzyme activities through regulating the expression of NF-E2-related nuclear factor 2 (Nrf2) mRNA. Together, these results indicated that Glu could attenuate Cu-induced cellular oxidative damage in fish intestine, likely mediated through Nrf2 signalling pathways regulating mRNA expressions of antioxidant enzyme genes and synthesis of GSH.</jats:p>},

We herein describe in detail a case series of liver disease patients (n\NBSP=\NBSP12) who presented with signs of copper deficiency based on serum and liver copper measurements. Median age of the group at the time of presentation was 39 (range 1864 years). Six patients were female. The median serum copper was 46 upmug/dL (normal range: 80155 upmug/dL for women and 70140 upmug/dL for men). Seven of the 12 patients had hepatic copper concentration less than 10 upmug/g dry weight (normal range: 1035 upmug/g).

abstract = {<jats:p>Ceruloplasmin is a ferroxidase that plays a role in iron homeostasis; its deficiency fosters inter alia iron accumulation in the liver, which expresses the soluble form of the protein secreted into the bloodstream. Ceruloplasmin is also secreted by the adipose tissue, but its role in adipocytes has been poorly investigated. We hypothesized that ceruloplasmin might have a role in iron/lipid interplay. We investigated iron/lipid dysmetabolism in the liver and adipose tissue of the ceruloplasmin-deficient mouse (CpKO) model of aceruloplasminemia and evaluated the effectiveness of ceruloplasmin replacement. We found that CpKO mice were overweight, showing adipose tissue accumulation, liver iron deposition and steatosis. In the adipose tissue of CpKO mice, iron homeostasis was not altered. Conversely, the levels of adiponectin and leptin adipokines behaved opposite to the wild-type. Increased macrophage infiltration was observed in adipose tissue and liver of CpKO mice, indicating tissue inflammation. The treatment of CpKO mice with ceruloplasmin limited liver iron accumulation and steatosis without normalizing the expression of iron homeostasis-related proteins. In the CpKO mice, the protein replacement limited macrophage infiltration in both adipose and hepatic tissues reduced the level of serum triglycerides, and partially recovered adipokines levels in the adipose tissue. These results underline the link between iron and lipid dysmetabolism in ceruloplasmin-deficient mice, suggesting that ceruloplasmin in adipose tissue has an anti-inflammatory role rather than a role in iron homeostasis. Furthermore, these data also indicate that ceruloplasmin replacement therapy may be effective at a systemic level.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Vitamin C (ascorbic acid; AA) and copper (Cu2+) are well used supplements with many health-promoting actions. However, when they are used in combination, the Fenton reaction occurs, leading to the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. Given that kidney is vulnerable to many toxicants including free radicals, we speculated that the in vivo administration of AA plus Cu2+ may cause oxidative kidney injury. The purpose of this study was to address this possibility. Mice were administered with AA and Cu2+, alone or in combination, via oral gavage once a day for various periods. Changes in the systemic oxidative status, as well renal structure and functions, were examined. The administration of AA plus Cu2+ elevated protein oxidation in serum, intestine, bladder, and kidney, as evidenced by the increased sulfenic acid formation and decreased level of free sulfhydryl groups (-SH). The systemic oxidative stress induced by AA plus Cu2+ was associated with a significant loss of renal function and structure, as indicated by the increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and urinary proteins, as well as glomerular and tubular cell injury. These effects of AA and Cu2+ were only observed when used in combination, and could be entirely prevented by thiol antioxidant NAC. Further analysis using cultured renal tubular epithelial cells revealed that AA plus Cu2+ caused cellular protein oxidation and cell death, which could be abolished by NAC and catalase. Moreover, coincubation of AA and Cu2+ led to H2O2 production. Collectively, our study revealed that a combined administration of AA and Cu2+ resulted in systemic oxidative stress and renal cell injury. As health-promoting supplements, AA and Cu2+ should not be used together.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p> During newborn lung injury, excessive activity of lysyl oxidases (LOXs) disrupts extracellular matrix (ECM) formation. Previous studies indicate that TGFupbeta activation in the O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-injured mouse pup lung increases lysyl oxidase (LOX) expression. But how TGFupbeta regulates this, and whether the LOXs generate excess pulmonary aldehydes are unknown. First, we determined that O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-mediated lung injury increases LOX protein expression in TGFupbeta-stimulated pup lung interstitial fibroblasts. This regulation appeared to be direct; this is because TGFupbeta treatment also increased LOX protein expression in isolated pup lung fibroblasts. Then using a fibroblast cell line, we determined that TGFupbeta stimulates LOX expression at a transcriptional level via Smad2/3-dependent signaling. LOX is translated as a pro-protein that requires secretion and extracellular cleavage before assuming amine oxidase activity and, in some cells, reuptake with nuclear localization. We found that pro-LOX is processed in the newborn mouse pup lung. Also, O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-mediated injury was determined to increase pro-LOX secretion and nuclear LOX immunoreactivity particularly in areas populated with interstitial fibroblasts and exhibiting malformed ECM. Then, using molecular probes, we detected increased aldehyde levels in vivo in O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-injured pup lungs, which mapped to areas of increased pro-LOX secretion in lung sections. Increased activity of LOXs plays a critical role in the aldehyde generation; an inhibitor of LOXs prevented the elevation of aldehydes in the O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-injured pup lung. These results reveal new mechanisms of TGFupbeta and LOX in newborn lung disease and suggest that aldehyde-reactive probes might have utility in sensing the activation of LOXs in vivo during lung injury. </jats:p>},

abstract = {{This study determined taste thresholds for copper as its speciation was varied among free cupric ion, complexed cupric ion, and precipitated cupric particles. The impact of copper chemistry on taste is important as copper is added to many beverages and can be present in drinking water as a natural mineral or due to corrosion of copper plumbing. A one-of-five test was used to define thresholds with solutions containing 0.025-8 mg/l Cu (from copper sulfate) in distilled or mineralized water of varying pH. The mineralized water was designed to mimic the composition of a typical tap water. Group thresholds for copper in either distilled-deionized water or mineralized water were not significantly different and ranged from 0.4 to 0.8 mg/l Cu. A difference from control test was used to assess the impact of soluble and particulate copper on taste. Soluble copper species, including free cupric ion and complexed copper species, were readily tasted, while particulate copper was poorly tasted.}},

abstract = {<jats:p>Biologically active metals such as copper, zinc and iron are fundamental for sustaining life in different organisms with the regulation of cellular metal homeostasis tightly controlled through proteins that coordinate metal uptake, efflux and detoxification. Many of the proteins involved in either uptake or efflux of metals are localised and function on the plasma membrane, traffic between intracellular compartments depending upon the cellular metal environment and can undergo recycling via the endosomal pathway. The biogenesis of exosomes also occurs within the endosomal system, with several major neurodegenerative disease proteins shown to be released in association with these vesicles, including the amyloidupbeta (Aupbeta) peptide in Alzheimer's disease and the infectious prion protein involved in Prion diseases. Aupbeta peptide and the prion protein also bind biologically active metals and are postulated to play important roles in metal homeostasis. In this review, we will discuss the role of extracellular vesicles in Alzheimer's and Prion diseases and explore their potential contribution to metal homeostasis.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Cuproptosis is a recently recognized modality of cell death driven by intracellular copper-dependent mitochondrial stress. However, the mediators of the sterile inflammatory response to cuproptotic death are undetermined. Here, we report that high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a damage-associated molecular pattern, is released by cuproptotic cells to initiate inflammation. Mechanically, copper accumulation-induced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to promote HMGB1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased extracellular release. In contrast, genetic (using RNAi) or pharmacologic (using dorsomorphin) inhibition of AMPK activation limits cuproptosis and HMGB1 release. Functionally, the ability of HMGB1-deficient cuproptotic cells to promote advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptor (AGER, also known as RAGE)-dependent inflammatory cytokine production is greatly reduced. Thus, HMGB1 is a key immune mediator of cuproptosis-initiated sterile inflammation.},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec> <jats:title>Background</jats:title> <jats:p>Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a life-threatening heart disease and a common cause of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction and subsequent left or biventricular dilatation. A significant number of cases have a genetic etiology; however, as a complex disease, the exact genetic risk factors are largely unknown, and many patients remain without a molecular diagnosis.</jats:p> </jats:sec><jats:sec> <jats:title>Methods</jats:title> <jats:p>We performed GWAS followed by whole-genome, transcriptome, and immunohistochemical analyses in a spontaneously occurring canine model of DCM. Canine gene discovery was followed up in three human DCM cohorts.</jats:p> </jats:sec><jats:sec> <jats:title>Results</jats:title> <jats:p>Our results revealed two independent additive loci associated with the typical DCM phenotype comprising left ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilatation. We highlight two novel candidate genes, <jats:italic>RNF207</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>PRKAA2</jats:italic>, known for their involvement in cardiac action potentials, energy homeostasis, and morphology. We further illustrate the distinct genetic etiologies underlying the typical DCM phenotype and ventricular premature contractions. Finally, we followed up on the canine discoveries in human DCM patients and discovered candidate variants in our two novel genes.</jats:p> </jats:sec><jats:sec> <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title> <jats:p>Collectively, our study yields insight into the molecular pathophysiology of DCM and provides a large animal model for preclinical studies.</jats:p> </jats:sec>},

abstract = {Copper is an essential trace element for the human body. The epidemiological evidence for the association of dietary intake of copper with the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) is limited. We conducted an evaluation of the cross-sectional data gathered from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys spanning from 2007 to 2018, which comprised a total of 17,948 participants. To discern the distinct characteristics of the participants, we performed a univariate analysis and utilized a 1:2 ratio propensity score matching method to minimize the effects of selection bias. We employed weighted univariate as well as three multivariate logistic regression models both prior to and following matching, with the aim of examining the association between dietary copper intake and PD risk. Finally, we used the restricted cubic spline (RCS) methodology in order to investigate possible non-linear relationships. Furthermore, subgroup analysis was undertaken to elicit further understanding concerning the association between copper intake and PD. A negative correlation resulted between dietary copper intake and PD risk in both univariate and multivariate logistic regression models, prior to and following matching. Our findings demonstrate that there is a nonlinear, dose-dependent relationship between copper intake and PD, according to our RCS analysis. In subgroup analysis, copper intake was identified as an important protective factor for individuals who were non-Hispanic White, unmarried, and had completed higher education. Dietary copper intake was associated with the risk of PD. Supplementation of dietary copper may have potentially beneficial effects.},

abstract = {<jats:p> Histomorphologic, histochemical, and atomic absorption analysis studies were performed on liver tissue from 623 clinically normal purebred and mixed-breed dogs to assess the range of hepatic copper concentrations, the histologic distribution of copper, and the histomorphologic changes associated with the various copper concentrations that were found. Atomic absorption analysis revealed a continuous numerical spectrum ranging from less than 100 parts per million on a dry weight basis (ppm dw) to more than 2,000. No decisive numerical criterion was found that could be used to separate normal from abnormal copper concentrations because of this continuous array. The threshold for histochemical demonstration of copper-containing granules using rhodanine or rubeanic acid staining was 400 ppm dw. At this concentration the copper-containing granules were located in the centrilobular hepatocytes (zone 3 of Rappaport). Copper-containing granules were found in the midzonal and periportal hepatocytes (zones 2 and 1 of Rappaport) in livers with 1,000 ppm dw and higher copper concentrations. The majority of the 623 livers were normal histomorphologically. Multifocal hepatitis characterized by mixed inflammatory cell accumulation and centrilobular distribution was found to be associated with copper concentrations in the range of 2,000 ppm dw or higher. An appropriate upper limit for normal hepatic copper concentration in the dog was not determined based on the present study. </jats:p>},

Whether this also occurs during pregnancy and lactation, when iron supplementation is frequently recommended, is, however, unknown. Here, the hypothesis that high dietary iron will perturb copper homeostasis in pregnant and lactating dams and their pups was tested. We utilized a rat model of iron-deficiency/iron supplementation during pregnancy and lactation to assess this possibility. Rat dams were fed low-iron diets early in pregnancy, and then switched to one of 5 diets with normal (1\texttimes) to high iron (20\texttimes) until pups were 14 days old. Subsequently, copper and iron homeostasis, and intestinal copper absorption (by oral, intragastric gavage with 64Cu), were assessed. Copper depletion/deficiency occurred in the dams and pups as dietary iron increased, as evidenced by decrements in plasma ceruloplasmin (Cp) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) activity, depletion of hepatic copper, and liver iron loading. Intestinal copper transport and tissue 64Cu accumulation were lower in dams consuming excess iron, and tissue 64Cu was also low in suckling pups. In some cases, physiological disturbances were noted when dietary iron was only ~3-fold in excess, while for others, effects were observed when dietary iron was 10-20-fold in excess. Excess enteral iron thus antagonizes the absorption of dietary copper, causing copper depletion in dams and their suckling pups. Low milk copper is a likely explanation for copper depletion in the pups, but experimental proof of this awaits future experimentation.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Copper (Cu) is a vital element required for cellular growth and development; however, even slight changes in its homeostasis might lead to severe toxicity and deleterious medical conditions. Cancer patients are typically associated with higher Cu content in serum and tumor tissues, indicating increased demand of cancer cells for this micronutrient. Cu is known to readily cycle between the +1 and +2 oxidation state in biological systems. The mechanism of action of Cu complexes is typically based on their redox activity and induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to deadly oxidative stress. However, there are a number of other biomolecular mechanisms beyond ROS generation that contribute to the activity of anticancer Cu drug candidates. In this review, we discuss how interfering with intracellular Cu balance via either diet modification or addition of inorganic Cu supplements or Cu-modulating compounds affects tumor development, progression, and sensitivity to treatment modalities. We aim to provide the rationale for the use of Cu-depleting and Cu-overloading conditions to generate the best possible patient outcome with minimal toxicity. We also discuss the advantages of the use of pre-formed Cu complexes, such as Cu-(bis)thiosemicarbazones or Cu-N-heterocyclic thiosemicarbazones, in comparison with the in situ formed Cu complexes with metal-binding ligands. In this review, we summarize available clinical and mechanistic data on clinically relevant anticancer drug candidates, including Cu supplements, Cu chelators, Cu ionophores, and Cu complexes.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p> The trace metal copper (Cu) plays an essential role in biology as a cofactor for many enzymes that include Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase, cytochrome oxidase, ceruloplasmin, lysyl oxidase, and dopamine upbeta-hydroxylase. Consequently, Cu transport at the cell surface and the delivery of Cu to intracellular compartments are critical events for a wide variety of biological processes. The components that orchestrate intracellular Cu trafficking and their roles in Cu homeostasis have been elucidated by the studies of model microorganisms and by the characterizations of molecular basis of Cu-related genetic diseases, including Menkes disease and Wilson disease. However, little is known about the mechanisms for Cu uptake at the plasma membrane and the consequences of defects in this process in mammals. Here, we show that the mouse <jats:italic>Ctr1</jats:italic> gene encodes a component of the Cu transport machinery and that mice heterozygous for <jats:italic>Ctr1</jats:italic> exhibit tissue-specific defects in copper accumulation and in the activities of copper-dependent enzymes. Mice completely deficient for <jats:italic>Ctr1</jats:italic> exhibit profound growth and developmental defects and die <jats:italic>in utero</jats:italic> in mid-gestation. These results demonstrate a crucial role for Cu acquisition through the Ctr1 transporter for mammalian Cu homeostasis and embryonic development. </jats:p>},

Another disorder causing symptoms similar to copper metabolism disorder is Niemann-Pick type C.

The authors present an adolescent with an unusual presentation of copper deficiencydysarthria, ataxia, and vertical gaze paresis, without significant cognitive degeneration or pathological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patient was found to carry 2 mutations in the NPC1 gene. A possible link, explaining how copper deficiency might induce the Niemann-Pick phenotype might involve overproduction of cholesterol and inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase. We suggest that copper metabolism disorders be included in the differential diagnosis for ataxia and dysarthria, even in cases with unusual presentations. Moreover, should the connection between copper and Niemann-Pick be validated, screening for copper metabolism disorders may be advisable in Niemann-Pick type C patients and vice-versa. </jats:p>},

abstract = {<sec>BackgroundCopper (Cu) is essential for the functioning of various enzymes involved in important cellular and physiological processes. Although critical for normal cardiac function, excessive accumulation, or deficiency of Cu in the myocardium is detrimental to the heart. Fluctuations in cardiac Cu content have been shown to cause cardiac pathologies and imbalance in systemic Cu metabolism. However, the genetic basis underlying cardiac Cu levels and their effects on heart traits remain to be understood. Representing the largest murine genetic reference population, BXD strains have been widely used to explore genotype-phenotype associations and identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) and candidate genes.</sec><sec>MethodsCardiac Cu concentration and heart function in BXD strains were measured, followed by QTL mapping. The candidate genes modulating Cu homeostasis in mice hearts were identified using a multi-criteria scoring/filtering approach.</sec><sec>ResultsSignificant correlations were identified between cardiac Cu concentration and left ventricular (LV) internal diameter and volumes at end-diastole and end-systole, demonstrating that the BXDs with higher cardiac Cu levels have larger LV chamber. Conversely, cardiac Cu levels negatively correlated with LV posterior wall thickness, suggesting that lower Cu concentration in the heart is associated with LV hypertrophy. Genetic mapping identified six QTLs containing a total of 217 genes, which were further narrowed down to 21 genes that showed a significant association with cardiac Cu content in mice. Among those, Prex1 and Irx3 are the strongest candidates involved in cardiac Cu modulation.</sec><sec>ConclusionCardiac Cu level is significantly correlated with heart chamber size and hypertrophy phenotypes in BXD mice, while being regulated by multiple genes in several QTLs.

abstract = {<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title> <jats:p> In bacteria, the intracellular levels of metals are mediated by tightly controlled acquisition and efflux systems. This is particularly true of copper, a trace element that is universally toxic in excess. During infection, the toxic properties of copper are exploited by the mammalian host to facilitate bacterial clearance. To better understand the role of copper during infection, we characterized the contribution of the <jats:italic>cop</jats:italic> operon to copper homeostasis and virulence in <jats:named-content content-type=genus-species>Streptococcus pneumoniae</jats:named-content> . Deletion of either the exporter, encoded by <jats:italic>copA</jats:italic> , or the chaperone, encoded by <jats:italic>cupA</jats:italic> , led to hypersensitivity to copper stress. We further demonstrated that loss of the copper exporter encoded by <jats:italic>copA</jats:italic> led to decreased virulence in pulmonary, intraperitoneal, and intravenous models of infection. Deletion of <jats:italic>copA</jats:italic> resulted in enhanced macrophage-mediated bacterial clearance <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> . The attenuation phenotype of the <jats:italic>copA</jats:italic> mutant in the lung was found to be dependent on pulmonary macrophages, underscoring the importance of copper efflux in evading immune defenses. Overall, these data provide insight into the role of the <jats:italic>cop</jats:italic> operon in pneumococcal pathogenesis. </jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient but excess Cu is potentially toxic. Its important propensity to cycle between two oxidation states accounts for its frequent presence as a cofactor in many physiological processes through Cu-containing enzymes, including mitochondrial energy production (via cytochrome c-oxidase), protection against oxidative stress (via superoxide dismutase), and extracellular matrix stability (via lysyl oxidase). Since free Cu is potentially toxic, the bioavailability of intracellular Cu is tightly controlled by Cu transporters and Cu chaperones. Recent evidence reveals that these Cu transport systems play an essential role in the physiological responses of cardiovascular cells, including cell growth, migration, angiogenesis and wound repair. In response to growth factors, cytokines, and hypoxia, their expression, subcellular localization, and function are tightly regulated. Cu transport systems and their regulators have also been linked to various cardiovascular pathophysiologies such as hypertension, inflammation, atherosclerosis, diabetes, cardiac hypertrophy, and cardiomyopathy. A greater appreciation of the central importance of Cu transporters and Cu chaperones in cell signaling and gene expression in cardiovascular biology offers the possibility of identifying new therapeutic targets for cardiovascular disease.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>The Dahl salt-sensitive rat was used to investigate the effect of hypertension on indexes of copper status and to determine the extent to which dietary manipulation of copper attenuated, or exacerbated, the rate of sodium chloride-induced hypertension. Weanling salt-sensitive rats were fed, in a 2 x 3 factorial design, one of six diets that contained one of three levels of copper (2.0 micrograms/g marginal, 12 micrograms/g adequate, or 50 micrograms/g supplemental) and either control (0.4%) or high (4%) levels of sodium. Diets were fed to the rats for 11 weeks. Rats fed the high sodium diets were characterized by high plasma copper concentrations and ceruloplasmin activities compared with their respective control sodium rats. The magnitude of the sodium-induced rise in plasma copper and ceruloplasmin was affected by dietary copper intake; however, dietary copper intake had no effect on the development of hypertension in the high sodium groups. These results suggest that altered copper metabolism is secondary, rather than primary, to the development of sodium chloride-induced hypertension in the salt-sensitive rat. Red blood cell superoxide dismutase activity was reduced in rats fed the low copper diets compared with the adequate and supplemented copper groups. At the lower levels of copper intake, sodium chloride-induced hypertension increased red blood cell superoxide dismutase activity in a manner consistent with the plasma copper and ceruloplasmin changes observed. However, at adequate or supplemental levels of dietary copper, red blood cell superoxide dismutase activity plateaued, suggesting possible saturation of copper at sites of hematopoeisis.</jats:p>},

abstract = {{Copper (Cu) is an essential trace element for all aerobic organisms. It functions as a cofactor in enzymes that catalyze a wide variety of redox reactions due to its ability to cycle between two oxidation states, Cu(i) and Cu(ii). This same redox property of copper has the potential to cause toxicity if copper homeostasis is not maintained. Studies suggest that the toxic properties of copper are harnessed by the innate immune system of the host to kill bacteria. To counter such defenses, bacteria rely on copper tolerance genes for virulence within the host. These discoveries suggest bacterial copper intoxication is a component of host nutritional immunity, thus expanding our knowledge of the roles of copper in biology. This review summarizes our current understanding of copper tolerance in bacteria, and the extent to which these pathways contribute to bacterial virulence within the host.}},

Changes in carbohydrate metabolism are accompanied by oxidative stress, which may disturb the mineral balance.

For 8\NBSPweeks, male Wistar rats were fed these diets supplemented with 3{\%} Tau. Taurine supplementation normalized increased serum insulin concentration and insulin resistance index; however, it did not improve serum CRP concentration in high-fat diet fed rats. The high-fat diet supplemented with Tau decreased the renal and splenic Zn levels, but the tissular Fe content did not change. The effect of Tau supplementation on the mineral balance to some extent depended on the fat content in the rats' diet. The high-fat diet supplemented with Tau decreased the rats' splenic Zn levels but increased their femur levels. In the group fed the standard diet, Tau reduced the rats' femur Zn level, whereas their splenic Zn level was comparable. Tau supplementation decreased the renal Cu level and serum ceruloplasmin concentration in the rats fed the standard diet, but this effect was not observed in the rats fed the high-fat diet. In conclusion, supplementary taurine failed to ameliorate disturbances in mineral homeostasis caused by high-fat diet feeding and led to tissular redistribution of Zn and Cu in the rat.},

The homeostasis of gut microbiota impacts on the structural and functional integrity of gut epithelial barrier. Microbiota also serve as signalling sources to inform the host of the metabolism and functional changes. Microbiota dysbiosis negatively affect human health, contributing to diseases like obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases, and asthma. Not by coincidence, these pathological conditions are also closely related to the abnormal metabolism and function of H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S signalling.H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S serves as a bacterial signal to the host and the host-produced H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S impacts on the population and size of microbiota. These bi-directional interactions become especially important for the digestion and utilization of sulfur amino acid in diet. Dietary restriction of sulfur amino acid increases the endogenous production of H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S by the host and consequently offers many health benefits. It, on the other hand, decreases the nutritional supply to the microbiota, which could be remedied by the co-application of prebiotics and probiotics. It is strategically sound to target the expression of H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S-producing enzymes in different organs to slow aging processes in our body and promote better health.</jats:p>},

abstract = {{The lysosomal system operates as a focal point where a number of important physiological processes such as endocytosis, autophagy and nutrient sensing converge. One of the key functions of lysosomes consists of regulating the metabolism/homeostasis of metals. Metal-containing components are carried to the lysosome through incoming membrane flows, while numerous transporters allow metal ions to move across the lysosome membrane. These properties enable lysosomes to direct metal fluxes to the sites where metal ions are either used by cellular components or sequestered. Copper belongs to a group of metals that are essential for the activity of vitally important enzymes, although it is toxic when in excess. Thus, copper uptake, supply and intracellular compartmentalization have to be tightly regulated. An increasing number of publications have indicated that these processes involve lysosomes. Here we review studies that reveal the expanding role of the lysosomal system as a hub for the control of Cu homeostasis and for the regulation of key Cu-dependent processes in health and disease.}},

Surgical intervention may need to be considered in dogs that do not respond or have respiratory compromise.

abstract = {{Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has been in the literature and news because of the recent opinion-based journal articles and public releases by regulatory agencies. DCM is commonly associated with a genetic predisposition in certain dog breeds and can also occur secondary to other diseases and nutritional deficiencies. Recent communications in veterinary journals have discussed a potential relationship between grain-free and/or novel protein diets to DCM, citing a subjective increase in DCM in dog breeds that are not known to have a genetic predisposition for the disease. This literature review describes clinical presentations of DCM, common sequelae, treatment and preventative measures, histopathologic features, and a discussion of the varied etiological origins of the disease. In addition, current literature limitations are addressed, in order to ascertain multiple variables leading to the development of DCM. Future studies are needed to evaluate one variable at a time and to minimize confounding variables and speculation. Furthermore, to prevent sampling bias with the current FDA reports, the veterinary community should be asked to provide information for all cases of DCM in dogs. This should include cases during the same time period, regardless of the practitioner's proposed etiology, due to no definitive association between diets with specific characteristics, such as, but not limited to, grain-free diets and those containing legumes, novel protein diets, and those produced by small manufacturers to DCM in dogs. In summary, in order to determine if certain ingredients, categories of diets, or manufacturing processes are related to an increased risk of DCM, further studies investigating these variables are necessary.}},

abstract = {Wilson{\textquoteright}s disease (WD) is a copper metabolic disorder, which is caused by defective ATP7B function. Here, we have generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from WD patients carrying compound heterozygous mutations on ATP7B. ATP7B loss- and gain-of-functions were further manifested with ATP7B-deficient iPSCs and heterozygously-corrected R778L WD patient-derived iPSCs using CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing. Transcriptome analysis identified abnormalities of retinoid signaling pathway and lipid metabolism in WD-specific hepatocytes. Although the expression level of ATP7B protein was variable among WD-specific hepatocytes, the expression and secretion of ceruloplasmin (Cp), which is a downstream copper carrier in plasma, were consistently decreased. Cp secretion-based drug screening identified all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) as promising candidates for rescuing Cp secretion. ATRA also alleviated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production induced by lipid accumulation in WD-specific hepatocytes. Our patient-derived iPSC-based hepatic models provide potential therapeutics for liver steatosis in WD and other fatty liver diseases.},

In-gel and spectrophotometric ferroxidase and amine oxidase assays demonstrated that Cp activity was enhanced when hepatic copper loading occurred. Interestingly, liver copper levels strongly correlated with Cp protein expression and activity. These observations support the possibility that liver copper loading increases metallation of the Cp protein, leading to increased production of the holo enzyme.

abstract = {Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is uniquely adapted to colonize the gastric mucosa. The key components for gastric colonization include motility, adhesion, and acid acclimation. The flagellar system allows the bacteria to move within the gastric mucus layer to the sites where conditions are optimal for survival. Adhesion to the gastric mucosa, via interaction between bacterial and host proteins, allows the bacteria to withstand the bulk flow of gastric fluid. Acid acclimation is the system that allows for periplasmic and cytoplasmic pH regulation in the setting of an acidic environment. The bacteria are bioenergetically neutralophiles, meaning they are able to survive between pH 4 and 8 and grow between pH 6 and 8. The pH at the gastric surface in the presence of H. pylori, as shown by microelectrode, fluorescent dye, and in vivo transcriptome studies, is below the range for growth and near to below the limits for survival. The bacteria are able to sense acidic medium pH and stimulate the trafficking of cytoplasmic urease and its accessory proteins to the proton-gated urea channel, UreI, in the inner membrane. The breakdown of urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia buffers the periplasm and cytoplasm to within the pH range optimal for a neutralophile. Understanding gastric colonization is clinically relevant because these systems that facilitate colonization can be targeted or interfered with to improve the efficacy of eradication regimens.},

abstract = {<jats:title>Significance</jats:title><jats:p>Zinc deficiency in the human population, a major public health concern, can also be a consequence of nutritional deficiency in protein uptake. The discovery that tryptophan metabolites 3-hydroxykynurenine and xanthurenic acid are major zinc-binding ligands in insect cells establishes the kynurenine pathway as a regulator of systemic zinc homeostasis. Many biological processes influenced by zinc and the kynurenine pathway, including the regulation of innate and acquired immune responses to viral infections, have not been studied in light of the direct molecular links revealed in this study.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The current contribution reviews absorption and metabolism of copper (Cu), Cu deficiency, Cu toxicity, Cu bioavailability, and effects of pharmacological levels of Cu on growth performance and intestinal health of pigs. Copper is a micro mineral involved in metabolic reactions including cellular respiration, tissue pigmentation, hemoglobin formation, and connective tissue development. Copper is mostly absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the duodenum, but some Cu is absorbed in the stomach. One way to evaluate the efficacy of sources of Cu is to measure relative bioavailability where responses include tissue concentrations of Cu, concentrations of metalloproteins, and enzymatic activity of animals fed test diets containing graded levels of Cu. The requirement for Cu by pigs is 5 to 10mg/kg diet, however, Cu can be included at growth-promoting levels (i.e., 75 to 250mg/kg diet) in diets for weanling and growing pigs to reduce post-weaning diarrhea and improve growth performance. The consistently observed improvement in growth performance upon Cu supplementation is likely a result of increases in lipase activity, growth hormone secretion, and expression of genes involved in post-absorptive metabolism of lipids. The growth-promoting effects of dietary Cu have also been attributed to its bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties because Cu may change bacterial populations in the intestine, and thereby reduce inflammation caused by pathogens. However, further research is needed to determine potential interactions between Cu and non-nutritive feed additives (e.g., enzymes, probiotics, phytobiotics), and the optimum quantity of Cu as well as the optimum duration of feeding supplemental Cu in diets for pigs should be further investigated. These gaps needs to be addressed to maximize inclusion of Cu in diets to improve growth performance while minimizing diseases and mortality.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Tryptophan is an essential amino acid with a huge functional versatility, in addition to its participation in protein synthesis. Because of the complexity of its metabolism, and the functional relevance of several of its metabolites, it directly or indirectly participates in a wide array of physiological pathways. This amino acid is a precursor for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter/neuromodulator serotonin (5<jats:styled-content style=fixed-case>HT</jats:styled-content>), the hormone melatonin and kynurenine and related compounds such as kynurenic acid, quinolinic acid or niacin. Because of this, it has a key role in the regulation of processes ranging from the neuroendocrine to the immune system in vertebrates. In aquaculture, extensive research has been performed to optimize the levels of tryptophan in the commercial diets for many fish species. Providing adequate levels of this amino acid is critically important for fish growth but also for fish welfare, as tryptophan has been shown to modulate fish behaviour, stress responses, and antioxidant and immune systems. Currently, available data suggest a wide variation in tryptophan requirements of different species ranging 0.3-1.3% of dietary protein level, but recent evidence also shows that fish tryptophan requirements can greatly vary depending on the rearing conditions of the fish. We also review here the participation of tryptophan and related metabolites in different physiological functions that are crucial for fish welfare. The review covers the involvement of tryptophan in 5<jats:styled-content style=fixed-case>HT</jats:styled-content> and melatoninmediated functions, along with its participation in the regulation of the immune system and its role as an antioxidant and antitoxic agent in fish.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) enzyme activity is usually measured as a part of liver function test (LFT) to detect increases in its activity. Less attention has been put to know the conditions associated with decreases in its activity. Micronutrients like Zinc (Zn) and Magnesium (Mg) are important causes of low ALP activity. Our Objective is to find out Zn and Mg deficiencies as important cause of decrease in ALP activity and to initiate supplementation of these minerals. The study was done to assess Zn and Mg deficiency in 42 persons having low ALP activity and 45 healthy controls. Correlation between minerals and ALP activities were also carried out. It was found that 52.38% of cases are Mg deficient and 47.62% cases are Zn deficient. A significant decrease in Zn and Mg was observed in low ALP cases when compared with control (p\&lt;0.001, p\&lt;0.05). Significant positive correlation was found between the minerals and ALP. Serum Zn and Mg are essential for human body and by screening their deficiency, supplementation of minerals can be initiated.</jats:p>},

abstract = {To clarify the changes of mineral levels in different tissues of riboflavin-deficient rats, Wistar rats were separated into three groups. One group was fed a diet ad libitum that was deficient in riboflavin. The other two were fed either the complete diet that was weight-matched to the riboflavin-deficient group or fed a complete diet ad libitum. In riboflavin-deficient rats, the hemoglobin concentration and riboflavin contents of blood, liver, and kidney were significantly decreased, compared with weight-matched and ad libitum-fed controls. The mineral concentrations of tissues are summarized as follows: The iron (Fe) concentration in the heart, liver, and spleen was decreased in the riboflavin-deficient group compared with the other groups. Calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) concentrations in tibia were decreased in the riboflavin-deficient group compared with the other two groups. Copper (Cu) concentration was increased in the heart and liver when the riboflavin-deficient group was compared with the other groups. Zinc (Zn) concentration was increased in tibia when the riboflavin-deficient group was compared with the other groups.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown Cu(0) as a promising material for the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants. However, there is no review addressing the studies performed. This fact may be related to the toxicity of the particles and the copper released in solution that has not motivated researchers, which entails in a reduced number of publications. However, studies point out how to solve the problem of Cu deposition in support materials. In this work, a detailed review of Cu(0) applications was performed. The specific focus was the reaction mechanisms related to adsorption, oxidation, and reduction processes. Initially, the resources that allow the understanding of the reaction mechanism, such as characterization techniques and the experimental conditions for investigation of the species involved in the process, were presented. The studies were evaluated separately, showing the mechanisms involved only with the application of Cu(0) in pure and isolated form and in association with oxidizing or reductive agents, combined with irradiation sources and ultrasonic waves and in the form supported in polymer matrices. It was verified that by the proposed reaction mechanisms, the exclusive participation of Cu(0), being the removal process, explained only by the redox behavior of copper. Therefore, the review showed the need for future research regarding the redox behavior of the contaminants.},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Iron is an essential element for almost all organisms on Earth. It is necessary for a number of crucial processes such as hemoglobin and myoglobin transport and storage of oxygen in mammals; electron transfer support in a variety of ironsulfur protein or cytochrome reactions; and activation and catalysis of reactions of a wide range of substrate like alkanes, olefins, and alcohols. Living organisms adopted iron as the main metal to carry out all of these functions due to the rich coordination chemistry of its two main redox states, Fe<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> and Fe<jats:sup>3+</jats:sup>, and because of its abundance in the Earth's crust and oceans. This paper presents an overview of the coordination chemistry of iron that makes it suitable for a large variety of functions within biological systems. Despite iron's chemical advantages, organisms were forced to manage with some drawbacks: Fe<jats:sup>3+</jats:sup> insolubility and the formation of toxic radicals, especially the hydroxyl radical. Iron chemistry within biology is an example of how organisms evolved by creating molecular machinery to overcome these difficulties and perform crucial processes with extraordinary elegance and efficiency. \textrm{\small\textcopyright} 2017 IUBMB Life, 69(6):382-388, 2017</jats:p>},

abstract = {The interactions of iron, ascorbic acid and copper may be of concern to humans. Supplements of iron and ascorbic acid are consumed by nearly 30{\%} and 60{\%} of adults, respectively (1), while copper intakes may be marginal (2). Consumption of 1500 mg ascorbic acid daily for 60 days depressed serum ceruloplasmin and copper in adult men (3). The severity of anemia in copper-deficient rats was increased by 1{\%} ascorbic acid in the diet (4). Ascorbic acid may increase the turnover or decrease the absorption of copper (5). We observed that ascorbic acid also decreases iron absorption in copper-deficient rats (4). It has been reported that supplements of iron lessen the severity of copper deficiency anemia in rats (6). However, high doses of iron do not reverse the anemia of copper deficiency in humans (7,8) and we reported that anemia was more severe in copper-deficient rats fed 226 rather than 54 $\mu$g Fe/g diet (9).},

abstract = {<jats:p>Human is evolved and nourished by food so food has been given the prime importance since Vedic period, but if our food itself is polluted then how the development of health hazards can be prevented or checked. The contamination of food is a major concern especially for developing countries like India. Today, society are very careful about the selection of food but unfortunately attention has not been given about selection of cookware and the impact of these cooking utensils on health. Number of good looking cookware sets are made by very dangerous material and coated by toxic chemicals to. Most commonly used cookware sets are Aluminum, Plastic and Non-stick cookware. During cooking process these cookware sets releases many hazardous substances like Teflon, BPA, Aluminum etc., which contaminates food and ultimately reaches to the body and linked as a causative factor for many diseases like Cancer, Alzheimer's disease etc. According to FDA materials that are used to make utensils should not allow to migrate into food. Though, traditionally Earthen pots, Cast- iron, glass, bamboo and copper, stone cookware sets were in use. Those were added therapeutic value in the cooked food. Thus, attention must be needed to choose the correct utensils for cooking which should be safe and beneficial for health. In Ayurveda during the description of eight dietary principles, importance of Vasana (utensils) is mentioned under the description of Karana (processing techniques of food items). Ayurveda believes that container helps in transformation of qualities of food items. Different kinds of utensils had been shown both positive and negative effect on body. Hence, this article makes an attempt to gathered data and compiled to find the health impacts of newly evolved as well as traditional cookware options in society.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Ten germ-free pigs and 10 conventionally reared pigs were fed one of two nutritionally balanced diets containing either 16 ppm Cu (basal) or 283 ppm Cu (high-Cu) to evaluate the physiological relationships between Cu and microbiological environment. Germ-free pigs tended to have higher ADG and average daily feed intake (ADFI) than conventionally reared pigs. Feeding the high-Cu diet tended to reduce ADG and ADFI in germ-free pigs but it increased ADG and ADFI in conventionally reared pigs. Hemoglobin and hematocrit were higher in germ-free pigs than in conventionally reared pigs (P \&lt; .001), and hematocrit (P \&lt; .01) and erythrocyte count (P \&lt; .06) were reduced by feeding the high-Cu diet. Germ-free pigs had lower total leukocyte count (P \&lt; .01) and the relative percentages of differentiated leukocytes were altered compared with conventionally reared pigs. Feeding the high-Cu diet increased the percentage of band neutrophils and monocytes in germ-free pigs but reduced the percentage of these cells in conventionally reared pigs (P \&lt; .04). Germ-free pigs had higher concentrations of Cu and Zn in liver and plasma (P \&lt; .001) and greater plasma ceruloplasmin oxidase activity (P \&lt; .001) than conventionally reared pigs did. The high-Cu diet increased liver Cu and Zn (P \&lt; .001) and plasma Cu (P \&lt; .001) and reduced liver and plasma Fe (P \&lt; .05). Organ weights (g/kg BW) differed between germ-free and conventionally reared pigs, and feeding the high-Cu diet reduced thymus weights (P \&lt; .002). Intestinal weight and thickness were reduced in germ-free pigs, and feeding the high-Cu diet generally reduced villus height and width and crypt depth in germ-free pigs, whereas it increased these measurements in conventionally reared pigs.</jats:p>},

abstract = {The feeding of diets enriched with ascorbic acid (10 g/kg) to rats has previously been shown to lower plasma and liver copper concentrations. The present studies corroborate this. We hypothesized that ascorbic acid initially reduces copper absorption, this effect being masked later by the stimulatory effect on copper absorption of the impaired copper status. We also hypothesized that the impaired copper status as induced by ascorbic acid feeding is followed by a diminished biliary excretion of copper in an attempt to preserve copper homeostasis. Our hypotheses are supported by the present studies. Ascorbic acid feeding initially reduced apparent copper absorption, and in the course of the experiment this effect tended to turn over into a stimulatory effect. Copper deficiency, as induced by feeding a diet containing 1 mg Cu/kg instead of 5 mg Cu/kg, systematically increased copper absorption. Biliary excretion of copper in rats given ascorbic acid was unaffected initialy but became depressed after prolonged ascorbic acid feeding. A similar time course was seen for fecal endogenous copper excretion that was calculated as the difference between true and apparent copper absorption. Copper deficiency systematically reduced biliary copper excretion and fecal endogenous copper loss.},

abstract = {Animals that are copper deficient have cardiac hypertrophy where there is a dramatic increase in mitochondria. Mitochondrial biogenesis is enhanced in this model and there is an upregulation of mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA) and nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 (NRF-1 and NRF-2). While the cuproenzyme, cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), is an attractive candidate to explain the connection between cardiac hypertrophy in copper deficiency and subsequent mitochondrial biogenesis, studies have revealed that ATP synthase may be impacted by copper depletion. NRF-1 and NRF-2 can bind to some of the subunits of both CCO and ATP synthase to regulate gene expression. Furthermore, oxidative phosphorylation appears to occur unaltered in the copper-deficient state. Copper-deficient mitochondria appear to be less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of oligomycin compared to controls. Decreases in the $\delta$ subunit protein and $\beta$ mRNA transcript have been reported for ATP synthase as a function of copper deficiency. The limited data available suggest that copper, either indirectly or directly, alters ATP synthase function.},

To investigate this hypothesis, intragastrically fed 2-day-old piglets were fed one of three treatments for 8 days: 1) a threonine-adequate diet (IG-A; 0.6 g threonine\textperiodcenteredkg<jats:sup>minus1</jats:sup>\textperiodcenteredday<jats:sup>minus1</jats:sup> fed intragastrically); 2) a threonine-deficient diet (IG-D; 0.1 g threonine\textperiodcenteredkg<jats:sup>minus1</jats:sup>\textperiodcenteredday<jats:sup>minus1</jats:sup> fed intragastrically); or 3) a threonine-deficient diet with adequate threonine delivered parenterally (IV-A; 0.5 g threonine\textperiodcenteredkg<jats:sup>minus1</jats:sup>\textperiodcenteredday<jats:sup>minus1</jats:sup> fed parenterally plus 0.1 g threonine\textperiodcenteredkg<jats:sup>minus1</jats:sup>\textperiodcenteredday<jats:sup>minus1</jats:sup> fed intragastrically). IG-D piglets experienced higher nitrogen excretion, higher plasma urea, and lower plasma threonine concentrations versus both of the other groups ( P \&lt; 0.05), indicating profound threonine deficiency. Mucosal mass and total crude mucin content were lower in the colons of IG-D pigs ( P \&lt; 0.05). Histopathological analysis showed lower numbers of acidic mucin-producing goblet cells in the duodenum and ileum of IG-D pigs. In IG-D pigs, acidic mucin subtypes were lower in the small intestine but higher in the colon, which corresponded with persistent diarrhea. The parenteral supply of threonine was adequate to maintain most outcome parameters, although IV-A pigs did have smaller colonic goblet cells with more acidic mucins compared with IG-A pigs. Overall, our results suggest that adequate dietary threonine was critical in the production of mucus and that a parenteral threonine supply can ameliorate most of the symptoms of oral threonine deficiency. </jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, age-related progressive neurological disorder, and the most common type of dementia in aged people. Neuropathological lesions of AD are neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and senile plaques comprise the accumulated amyloid-beta (Aupbeta), loaded with metal ions including Cu, Fe, or Zn. Some reports have identified metal dyshomeostasis as a neurotoxic factor of AD, among which Cu ions seem to be a central cationic metal in the formation of plaque and soluble oligomers, and have an essential role in the AD pathology. Cu-Aupbeta complex catalyzes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and results in oxidative damage. Several studies have indicated that oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD. The connection of copper levels in AD is still ambiguous, as some researches indicate a Cu deficiency, while others show its higher content in AD, and therefore there is a need to increase and decrease its levels in animal models, respectively, to study which one is the cause. For more than twenty years, many in vitro studies have been devoted to identifying metals' roles in Aupbeta accumulation, oxidative damage, and neurotoxicity. Towards the end, a short review of the modern therapeutic approach in chelation therapy, with the main focus on Cu ions, is discussed. Despite the lack of strong proofs of clinical advantage so far, the conjecture that using a therapeutic metal chelator is an effective strategy for AD remains popular. However, some recent reports of genetic-regulating copper transporters in AD models have shed light on treating this refractory disease.

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause of dementia and death in the elderly, but its etiology is poorly understood. In recent years, Sparks and Schreurs (2003) have developed a rabbit model which displays 12 AD characteristics; however, the activity of brain cytochrome c oxidase (COX), which is usually low in AD, has not yet been assessed. In this study, we assessed activity of brain COX for Sparks' model. New Zealand white rabbits were maintained on the specified cholesterol-copper diet for a 10-week period following which brain mitochondria were isolated. The activity of COX within the mitochondria was assessed by polarographic assay; we also evaluated the spectral properties of the mitochondria and employed sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to investigate their protein composition. Finally, we attempted to isolate COX and studied its subunit composition by SDS-PAGE. Polarographic assay revealed that compared to the controls, 44{\%} of the rabbits on the cholesterol-copper diet had significantly decreased brain COX activity; on average, the Vmax of the high affinity site of mitochondria from the cholesterol-copper-fed rabbits was 26{\%} lower than that of the controls. In addition, the difference spectra of brain mitochondria obtained from 33{\%} of the rabbits raised on the cholesterol-copper diet, showed 35--40{\%} diminished absorbance in the 430\NBSPnm region suggesting decreased concentration or reducibility of COX or another heme protein. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that, for the rabbits raised on the cholesterol-copper diet, a number of COX subunits (VI--VII) were loosely held and easily lost during attempts to isolate the enzyme.},
abstract_as_rcvd = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause of dementia and death in the elderly, but its etiology is poorly understood. In recent years, Sparks and Schreurs (2003) have developed a rabbit model which displays 12 AD characteristics; however, the activity of brain cytochrome c oxidase (COX), which is usually low in AD, has not yet been assessed. In this study, we assessed activity of brain COX for Sparks' model. New Zealand white rabbits were maintained on the specified cholesterol-copper diet for a 10-week period following which brain mitochondria were isolated. The activity of COX within the mitochondria was assessed by polarographic assay; we also evaluated the spectral properties of the mitochondria and employed sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to investigate their protein composition. Finally, we attempted to isolate COX and studied its subunit composition by SDS-PAGE. Polarographic assay revealed that compared to the controls, 44{\%} of the rabbits on the cholesterol-copper diet had significantly decreased brain COX activity; on average, the Vmax of the high affinity site of mitochondria from the cholesterol-copper-fed rabbits was 26{\%} lower than that of the controls. In addition, the difference spectra of brain mitochondria obtained from 33{\%} of the rabbits raised on the cholesterol-copper diet, showed 35--40{\%} diminished absorbance in the 430nm region suggesting decreased concentration or reducibility of COX or another heme protein. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that, for the rabbits raised on the cholesterol-copper diet, a number of COX subunits (VI--VII) were loosely held and easily lost during attempts to isolate the enzyme.},

abstract = {<jats:title>Significance</jats:title> <jats:p>Proteins and enzymes are susceptible to oxidative damage and inactivation from reactive oxygen and nitrogen species formed as a consequence of oxidative stress. They also are at risk from oxidizing intermediates formed during enzymatic turnover. A survey of the protein structural database has revealed that one third of structurally characterized proteins contain chains of redox-active tyrosine and tryptophan residues. These chains can protect proteins from damage by transferring oxidizing equivalents away from critical active site regions and delivering them to surface sites for scavenging.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Trp is unique among the amino acids since it is involved in many different types of noncovalent interactions such as electrostatic and hydrophobic ones, but also in uppi-uppi, uppi-cation, uppi-anion and uppi-ion pair interactions. In membranotropic peptides and proteins, Trp locates preferentially at the water-membrane interface. In antimicrobial or cell-penetrating peptides (AMPs and CPPs respectively), Trp is well-known for its strong role in the capacity of these peptides to interact and affect the membrane organisation of both bacteria and animal cells at the level of the lipid bilayer. This essential amino acid can however be involved in other types of interactions, not only with lipids, but also with other membrane partners, that are crucial to understand the functional roles of membranotropic peptides. This review is focused on this latter less known role of Trp and describes in details, both in qualitative and quantitative ways: (i) the physico-chemical properties of Trp; (ii) its effect in CPP internalisation; (iii) its importance in AMP activity; (iv) its role in the interaction of AMPs with glycoconjugates or lipids in bacteria membranes and the consequences on the activity of the peptides; (v) its role in the interaction of CPPs with negatively charged polysaccharides or lipids of animal membranes and the consequences on the activity of the peptides. We intend to bring highlights of the physico-chemical properties of Trp and describe its extensive possibilities of interactions, not only at the well-known level of the lipid bilayer, but with other less considered cell membrane components, such as carbohydrates and the extracellular matrix. The focus on these interactions will allow the reader to reevaluate reported studies. Altogether, our review gathers dedicated studies to show how unique are Trp properties, which should be taken into account to design future membranotropic peptides with expected antimicrobial or cell-penetrating activity.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Waterflood-assisted oil recovery with sulfate-spiked seawater would cause incompatibility scaling in carbonate reservoirs and reduce economic benefits. This research investigated the benefits of polyphosphate compounds in reducing scaling potential as well as its effect on oil recovery when mixed in high sulfate flood water. Severity of scaling potential of sulfate-spiked water in a carbonate reservoir environment was measured, followed by systematic screening of a polyphosphate compound, which successfully inhibited the sulfate scale precipitation at concentration as low as 100\NBSPppm. The new formulation (seawater with four times sulfate and phosphate, SW4SP) was evaluated and compared with benchmark formulation (modified seawater with four times sulfate, SW4S). Contact angle, $\zeta$-potential and drainage studies show that SW4SP changed the rock wettability from oil wet to water wet to a larger degree compared to SW4S. Improved recovery efficiency of SW4SP was confirmed through a set of core flooding studies in the tertiary and quaternary flood modes. Whereas SW4S recovered 7.7{\%} of original oil in place (OOIP), SW4SP recovered about 8{\%} of OOIP in the tertiary mode under approximately identical flow conditions. Flooding with SW4SP in the quaternary mode following a tertiary flood with SW4S on the same core resulted in 1.7{\%} additional oil recovery, showing improved efficiency of the new flood water formulation.},

abstract = {<jats:p>How do organisms deal with free iron? On the one hand, iron is an essential metal that plays crucial structural and functional roles in many organisms. On the other hand, free iron is extremely toxic, particularly under aerobic conditions, where iron rapidly undergoes the Fenton reaction and produces highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. Our study now demonstrates that we have discovered one of the first physiologically relevant nonproteinaceous iron chelators and Fenton inhibitors. We found that polyphosphate, a highly conserved and ubiquitous inorganic polyanion, chelates iron and, through its multivalency, prevents the interaction of iron with peroxide and therefore the formation of hydroxyl radicals. We show that polyP provides a crucial iron reservoir for metalloproteins under nonstress conditions and effectively chelates free iron during iron stress. Importantly, polyP is present in all cells and organisms and hence is likely to take on this crucial function in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Hypothyroidism was diagnosed in 50 dogs and excluded in 86 dogs suspected of hypothyroidism, on the basis of the results of bovine thyrotropin response tests. Breed, pedigree, sex or neutering status did not significantly influence the likelihood of the dogs being hypothyroid. The hypothyroid dogs were significantly older than the nonhypothyroid dogs referred to the University of Glasgow during the same period. However, when dogs under two years of age were excluded from the statistical analyses there was no significant difference in age between the two groups. The most common clinical characteristics associated with hypothyroidism were metabolic signs (84 per cent of cases), particularly lethargy (76 per cent), obesity or weight gain (44 per cent), and exercise intolerance (24 per cent); and dermatological abnormalities (80 per cent), including alopecia (56 per cent), poor coat quality (30 per cent) and hyperpigmentation (20 per cent). When compared with the laboratory reference limits the most common biochemical and haematological abnormalities were increased concentrations of triglycerides (88 per cent), cholesterol (78 per cent), glucose (49 per cent), and fructosamine (43 per cent), and increased activities of creatine kinase (35 per cent), and decreased concentrations of inorganic phosphate (63 per cent), and a low red blood cell count (40 per cent). When compared with reference limits derived from the euthyroid dogs the most common abnormalities were increased concentrations of upgammaglutamyltransferase (21 per cent), cholesterol (18 per cent), and aspartate aminotransferase (15 per cent) and a decreased red blood cell count (29 per cent), and decreased neutrophils (18 per cent) and decreased activity of creatine kinase (15 per cent). Assessment of cholesterol, creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, upgammaglutamyltransferase, and red blood cell and neutrophil counts may be particularly useful in distinguishing hypothyroid dogs from euthyroid animals with similar clinical signs.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>ABSTRACT: The present evaluated the effects of copper sulfate solution (CSS) and arginine powder (Arg) supplements on performance, thyroid hormones and blood biochemistry of broiler chickens fed with canola meal (CM)-based diets. The experimental design was completely randomized with a 3 \texttimes 3 factorial and 9 treatments, corresponding to 3 levels of CSS (0, 125 and 250 mg/kg) and 3 levels of Arg (0, 0.1 and 0.2%) (n = 45 per treatment). Feeds were offered ad libitum for 21 days, from 22 to 42 days of age. Feed efficiency was significantly affected by the dietary addition of 250 mg/kg CSS and 0.2% Arg, and by the CSS \texttimes Arg interaction. CM supplemented with CSS improved the thyroid gland status and increased the plasma levels of triiodothyronine and thyroxine. Birds fed diets supplemented with 0.2% Arg had lower blood glucose level than the other treatments. The addition of 250 mg/kg CSS and 0.2% Arg reduced the stress caused by the rapid growth of broilers, also increasing the overall bird welfare.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Thyroid hormone action is mediated by the thyroid hormone receptors TRupalpha1 and TRupbeta. Defects in TRupbeta lead to RTH (resistance to thyroid hormone) upbeta, a syndrome characterized by high levels of thyroid hormone and non-suppressed TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone). However, a correct diagnosis of RTHupbeta patients is difficult as the clinical picture varies. A biochemical serum marker indicative of defects in TRupbeta signalling is needed and could simplify the diagnosis of RTHupbeta, in particular the differentiation to TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas, which present with clinically similar symptoms. In the present paper we show that serum copper levels are regulated by thyroid hormone, which stimulates the synthesis and the export of the hepatic copper-transport protein ceruloplasmin into the serum. This is accompanied by a concerted reduction in the mRNA levels of other copper-containing proteins such as metallothioneins 1 and 2 or superoxide dismutase 1. The induction of serum copper is abolished in genetically hyperthyroid mice lacking TRupbeta and human RTHupbeta patients, demonstrating an important role of TRupbeta for this process. Together with a previously reported TRupalpha1 specific regulation of serum selenium, we show that the ratio of serum copper and selenium, which is largely independent of thyroid hormone levels, volume changes or sample degradation, can constitute a valuable novel biomarker for RTHupbeta. Moreover, it could also provide a suitable large-scale screening parameter to identify RTHupalpha patients, which have not been identified to date.</jats:p>},

Despite their normal endocrine response to cold, PAM+/minus mice were unable to maintain body temperature as well as wild-type littermates when kept in a 4 C environment. When provided with additional dietary copper, PAM+/minus mice maintained body temperature as well as wild-type mice. Pharmacological activation of vasoconstriction or shivering also allowed PAM+/minus mice to maintain body temperature. Cold-induced vasoconstriction was deficient in PAM+/minus mice.

abstract = {\NBSP Decreased thyroid hormone synthesis and low levels of circulating thyroid hormones result in biochemical and/or clinical hypothyroidism. Deficiency of thyroid hormones causes many metabolic processes to slow down. The maintenance of optimal health requires an adequate supply of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, and macronutrients, micronutrients, and trace elements. In this work, the serum content of the trace elements; Zn, Cu, Mn, and Se in hypothyroidism patients was determined and compared to that of normal subjects. Seventy three ypothyroid patients and fifty normal healthy control persons participated in this study. Serum zinc and copper were determined using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer, while determination of manganese and selenium were done using flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The results showed that serum zinc and selenium level of hypothyroidism patients are significantly lower (p<0.05) than the level in normal subjects. A significant increase in serum manganese level was demonstrated in patients as compared with that of the normal subjects while there is no significant difference between the groups (p>0.05) in serum copper. The results of this work as discussed indicate, the role of these trace elements in many metabolic process either as essential nutrients or as cofactors for different enzymes contributed directly or indirectly to the hypothyroidism. Consequently, the results of this study suggest that the metabolism of zinc, manganese, and selenium is abnormal in hypothyroidism disease.},

abstract = {Zinc is the second most prevalent metal element present in living organisms, and control of its concentration is pivotal to physiology. The amount of zinc available to the cell cytoplasm is regulated by the activity of members of the SLC39 family, the ZIP proteins. Selectivity of ZIP transporters has been the focus of earlier studies which provided a biochemical and structural basis for the selectivity for zinc over other metals such as copper, iron, and manganese. However, several previous studies have shown how certain ZIP proteins exhibit higher selectivity for metal elements other than zinc. Sequence similarities suggest an evolutionary basis for the elemental selectivity within the ZIP family. Here, by engineering HEK293 cells to overexpress ZIP proteins, we have studied the selectivity of two phylogenetic clades of ZIP proteins, that is ZIP8/ZIP14 (previously known to be iron and manganese transporters) and ZIP5/ZIP10. By incubating ZIP over-expressing cells in presence of several divalent metals, we found that ZIP5 and ZIP10 are high affinity copper transporters with greater selectivity over other elements, revealing a novel substrate signature for the ZIP5/ZIP10 clade.},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Copper is a required micronutrient for bacteria and an essential cofactor for redoxactive cuproenzymes. Yet, excess copper is extremely toxic, and is exploited as a bacteriocide in medical and biotechnological applications and also by the mammalian immune system. To evade copper toxicity, bacteria not only control intracellular copper homeostasis, but they must also repair the damage caused by excess copper. In this review, we summarize the bacterial cellwide response to copper toxicity in Enterobacteria. Tapping into the abundant research data on two key organisms, <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Salmonella enterica,</jats:italic> we show that copper resistance requires both the direct copper homeostatic response and also the indirect accessory pathways that deal with copperinduced damage. Since patterns of copper response are conserved through the Proteobacteria, we propose a cellwide view of copper detoxification and copper tolerance that can be used to identify novel targets for copperbased antibacterial therapeutics.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Copper is an essential trace element for the human body, and its requirement for optimistic immune functions has been recognized for decades. How copper is involved in the innate immune pathway, however, remains to be clarified. Here, we report that copper serves as a signal molecule to regulate the kinase activity of alpha-kinase 1 (ALPK1), a cytosolic pattern-recognition receptor (PRR), and therefore promotes host cell defense against bacterial infection. We show that in response to infection, host cells actively accumulate copper in the cytosol, and the accumulated cytosolic copper enhances host cell defense against evading pathogens, including intracellular and, unexpectedly, extracellular bacteria. Subsequently, we demonstrate that copper activates the innate immune pathway of host cells in an ALPK1-dependent manner. Further mechanistic studies reveal that copper binds to ALPK1 directly and is essential for the kinase activity of this cytosolic PRR. Moreover, the binding of copper to ALPK1 enhances the sensitivity of ALPK1 to the bacterial metabolite ADP-heptose and eventually prompts host cells to elicit an enhanced immune response during bacterial infection. Finally, using a zebrafish in vivo model, we show that a copper-treated host shows an increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, enhanced recruitment of phagosome cells, and promoted bacterial clearance. Our findings uncover a previously unrecognized role of copper in the modulation of host innate immune response against bacterial pathogens and advance our knowledge on the cross talk between cytosolic copper homeostasis and immune system.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Fluopsin C (FlpC) is an organocupric secondary metabolite with low-molecular-weight, produced by some Pseudomonas and Streptomyces bacteria. The compound was identified in 1970 as prismatic dark-green crystals, with strong antimicrobial activity against several human and phytopathogens. Due to its high cytotoxicity, research on this compound decreased after the 1970s. During the early 2000s, FlpC gained more attention as a promising compound by which to develop new antimicrobials to control human, animal, and plant pathogens. This study provides an overview of the results pertaining to the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of pure FlpC, as well as semi-purified fractions containing FlpC, against phytopathogenic microorganisms. Furthermore, the bioprospection history of the extensively researched FlpC-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa LV strain and the related molecular evidence regarding the compound's biosynthesis are discussed. Overall, FlpC is proposed to be an important alternative to antimicrobial resistance in human and animal health, and in tackling the negative environmental impacts caused by the exacerbated use of pesticides against phytopathogens.</jats:p>},

Though the rates are on the decline, it is essential that physicians are aware of its lethal complications and management strategies. The main complications of copper sulphate ingestion include intravascular haemolysis, methaemoglobinaemia, acute kidney injury and rhabdomyolysis. The lethal dose can be as small as 10 grams. We have explored the complications of acute copper sulphate poisoning with examples from two case presentations. We also recommend measures for prevention of such events.</jats:p>},

While the phenomenon was already known in ancient times, it is currently receiving renewed attention. This is due to the potential use of copper as an antibacterial material in health care settings. Contact killing was observed to take place at a rate of at least 7 to 8 logs per hour, and no live microorganisms were generally recovered from copper surfaces after prolonged incubation. The antimicrobial activity of copper and copper alloys is now well established, and copper has recently been registered at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as the first solid antimicrobial material. In several clinical studies, copper has been evaluated for use on touch surfaces, such as door handles, bathroom fixtures, or bed rails, in attempts to curb nosocomial infections. In connection to these new applications of copper, it is important to understand the mechanism of contact killing since it may bear on central issues, such as the possibility of the emergence and spread of resistant organisms, cleaning procedures, and questions of material and object engineering. Recent work has shed light on mechanistic aspects of contact killing. These findings will be reviewed here and juxtaposed with the toxicity mechanisms of ionic copper.

abstract = {<jats:p>Available options to combat bacterial infections are getting scarce. We require innovative and imaginative approaches to enhance the identification and discovery of effective antimicrobials capable of combating bacteria resistant to multiple or all available drugs. These methods should either directly eliminate the resistant bacteria or influence their viability indirectly by inhibiting their virulence or reducing their resistance to antibacterial agents. One interesting approach is to analyze ancient remedies presumably used to treat bacterial infections, try formulating them, and test them against modern microbes. The field was recently named ancientbiotics. This approach allows us to take advantage of centuries of accumulated empirical knowledge, from several traditional medicines of various ancient cultures across the world. The strategy has already resulted in promising formulations to combat the ESKAPE group of nosocomial pathogens. Moreover, molecular de-extinction consists of genome analysis of extinct species in the search for useful antimicrobials, such as peptides. The de-extinction of simple organisms such as bacteriophages may eventually become a resource for novel tools to combat multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this review, we summarize and discuss the reported antimicrobial effects of ancient remedies and de-extinct molecules known to modern science, and discuss possible new strategies to further harness the potential of past remedies and molecules to help us fight the rise of superbugs.</jats:p>},

abstract = {The hepatic content of amyloid beta (Abeta) decreases drastically in human and rodent cirrhosis highlighting the importance of understanding the consequences of Abeta deficiency in the liver. This is especially relevant in view of recent advances in anti-Abeta therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, it is shown that partial hepatic loss of Abeta in transgenic AD mice immunized with Abeta antibody 3D6 and its absence in amyloid precursor protein (APP) knockout mice (APP-KO), as well as in human liver spheroids with APP knockdown upregulates classical hallmarks of fibrosis, smooth muscle alpha-actin, and collagen type I. Abeta absence in APP-KO and deficiency in immunized mice lead to strong activation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta), alpha secretases, NOTCH pathway, inflammation, decreased permeability of liver sinusoids, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Inversely, increased systemic and intrahepatic levels of Abeta42 in transgenic AD mice and neprilysin inhibitor LBQ657-treated wild-type mice protect the liver against carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4) )-induced injury. Transcriptomic analysis of CCl(4) -treated transgenic AD mouse livers uncovers the regulatory effects of Abeta42 on mitochondrial function, lipid metabolism, and its onco-suppressive effects accompanied by reduced synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins. Combined, these data reveal Abeta as an indispensable regulator of cell-cell interactions in healthy liver and a powerful protector against liver fibrosis.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized clinically by cognitive decline and pathologically by the accumulation of amyloid--containing senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. A great deal of attention has focused on amyloid- as the major pathogenic mechanisms with the ultimate goal of using amyloid- lowering therapies as an avenue of treatment. Unfortunately, nearly a quarter century later, no tangible progress has been offered, whereas spectacular failure tends to be the most compelling. We have long contended, as has substantial literature, that proteinaceous accumulations are simply downstream and, often, endstage manifestations of disease. Their overall poor correlation with the level of dementia, and their presence in the cognitively intact is evidence that is often ignored as an inconvenient truth. Current research examining amyloid oligomers, therefore, will add copious details to what is, in essence, a reductionist distraction from upstream pleiotrophic processes such as oxidative stress, cell cycle dysfunction, and inflammation. It is now long overdue that the neuroscientists avoid the pitfall of perseverating on proteinopathies and recognize that the continued targeting of end stage lesions in the face of repeated failure, or worse, is a losing proposition.},

abstract = {Age is a significant risk factor for ischemic stroke. However, the influence of aging on coagulation parameters in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) remains unclear. A total of 775 samples were collected from 224 NVAF patients receiving apixaban, edoxaban or rivaroxaban. The samples were categorized into three age groups: (i) </= 64 years, (ii) 65-74 years, and (iii) >/= 75 years (apixaban: N = 48, 108, 119; edoxaban: N = 63, 68, 126; rivaroxaban: N = 115, 90, 38, respectively). Coagulation parameters including fibrinogen (Fbg), factor II, factor V, factor VII, factor X, and D-dimer, were compared between the three age groups for each drug. The slopes in the correlation between drug concentrations and modified diluted prothrombin time (mdPT) were also assessed. Fbg and factor V increased with age, while factor II and factor X decreased. Factor VII and D-dimer showed no significant differences across age categories. The slope in response to drug concentrations was similar between the age groups. In NVAF patients treated with apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban, some coagulation parameters exhibited age-related variation. However, the response of mdPT to drug concentration was consistent across age categories.},

abstract = {Fibrinogen is an abundant protein synthesized in the liver, present in human blood plasma at concentrations ranging from 1.5-4 g/L in healthy individuals with a normal half-life of 3-5 days. With fibrin, produced by thrombin-mediated cleavage, fibrinogen plays important roles in many physiological processes. Indeed, the formation of a stable blood clot, containing polymerized and cross-linked fibrin, is crucial to prevent blood loss and drive wound healing upon vascular injury. A balance between clotting, notably the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, and fibrinolysis, the proteolytic degradation of the fibrin mesh, is essential. Disruption of this equilibrium can cause disease in distinct manners. While some pathological conditions are the consequence of altered levels of fibrinogen, others are related to structural properties of the molecule. The source of fibrinogen expression and the localization of fibrin(ogen) protein also have clinical implications. Low levels of fibrinogen expression have been detected in extra-hepatic tissues, including carcinomas, potentially contributing to disease. Fibrin(ogen) deposits at aberrant sites including the central nervous system or kidney, can also be pathological. In this review, we discuss disorders in which fibrinogen and fibrin are implicated, highlighting mechanisms that may contribute to disease.},

abstract = {Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors are commonly divided into prohemorrhagic (FII, FVII, FIX, and FX) and antithrombotic (protein C and protein S). Furthermore, another protein (protein Z) does not seem strictly correlated with blood clotting. As a consequence of this assumption, vitamin K-dependent defects were considered as hemorrhagic or thrombotic disorders. Recent clinical observations, and especially, recent advances in molecular biology investigations, have demonstrated that this was incorrect. In 2009, it was demonstrated that the mutation Arg338Leu in exon 8 of FIX was associated with the appearance of a thrombophilic state and venous thrombosis. The defect was characterized by a 10-fold increased activity in FIX activity, while FIX antigen was only slightly increased (FIX Padua). On the other hand, it was noted on clinical grounds that the thrombosis, mainly venous, was present in about 2% to 3% of patients with FVII deficiency. It was subsequently demonstrated that 2 mutations in FVII, namely, Arg304Gln and Ala294Val, were particularly affected. Both these mutations are type 2 defects, namely, they show low activity but normal or near-normal FVII antigen. More recently, in 2011-2012, it was noted that prothrombin defects due to mutations of Arg596 to Leu, Gln, or Trp in exon 15 cause the appearance of a dysprothrombinemia that shows no bleeding tendency but instead a prothrombotic state with venous thrombosis. On the contrary, no abnormality of protein C or protein S has been shown to be associated with bleeding rather than with thrombosis. These studies have considerably widened the spectrum and significance of blood coagulation studies.},

abstract = {Reduced sulfatide level is found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Here, we demonstrate that amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing regulates sulfatide synthesis and vice versa. Different cell culture models and transgenic mice models devoid of APP processing or in particular the APP intracellular domain (AICD) reveal that AICD decreases Gal3st1/CST expression and subsequently sulfatide synthesis. In return, sulfatide supplementation decreases Abeta generation by reducing beta-secretase (BACE1) and gamma-secretase processing of APP. Increased BACE1 lysosomal degradation leads to reduced BACE1 protein level in endosomes. Reduced gamma-secretase activity is caused by a direct effect on gamma-secretase activity and reduced amounts of gamma-secretase components in lipid rafts. Similar changes were observed by analyzing cells and mice brain samples deficient of arylsulfatase A responsible for sulfatide degradation or knocked down in Gal3st1/CST. In line with these findings, addition of sulfatides to brain homogenates of AD patients resulted in reduced gamma-secretase activity. Human brain APP level shows a significant negative correlation with GAL3ST1/CST expression underlining the in vivo relevance of sulfatide homeostasis in AD.},

abstract = {Our group and others have reported a series of studies showing that heavy burdens of diarrheal diseases in the formative first two years of life in children in urban shantytowns have profound consequences of impaired physical and cognitive development lasting into later childhood and schooling. Based on these previous studies showing that apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is relatively common in favela children, we review recent data suggesting a protective role for the APOE4 allele in the cognitive and physical development of children with heavy burdens of diarrhea in early childhood. Despite being a marker for cognitive decline with Alzheimer's and cardiovascular diseases later in life, APOE4 appears to be important for cognitive development under the stress of heavy diarrhea. The reviewed findings provide a potential explanation for the survival advantage in evolution of the thrifty APOE4 allele and raise questions about its implications for human development under life-style changes and environmental challenges.},

abstract = {Mitotic homologous recombination promotes genome stability through the precise repair of DNA double-strand breaks and other lesions that are encountered during normal cellular metabolism and from exogenous insults. As a result, homologous recombination repair is essential during proliferative stages in development and during somatic cell renewal in adults to protect against cell death and mutagenic outcomes from DNA damage. Mutations in mammalian genes encoding homologous recombination proteins, including BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2, are associated with developmental abnormalities and tumorigenesis. Recent advances have provided a clearer understanding of the connections between these proteins and of the key steps of homologous recombination and DNA strand exchange.},

abstract = {Lysyl oxidase (LO) is a copper-dependent amine oxidase that plays a critical role in the biogenesis of connective tissue matrices by crosslinking the extracellular matrix proteins, collagen and elastin. Levels of LO increase in many fibrotic diseases, while expression of the enzyme is decreased in certain diseases involving impaired copper metabolism. While the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme is not yet available, many of its physical-chemical properties, its novel carbonyl cofactor, and its catalytic mechanism have been described. Lysyl oxidase is synthesized as a preproprotein, secreted as a 50 kDa, N-glycosylated proenzyme and then proteolytically cleaved to the 32 kDa, catalytically active, mature enzyme. Within the past decade, the gene encoding LO has been cloned, facilitating investigations of the regulation of expression of the enzyme in response to diverse stimuli and in numerous disease states. Transforming growth factor-beta, platelet-derived growth factor, angiotensin II, retinoic acid, fibroblast growth factor, altered serum conditions, and shear stress are among the effectors or conditions that regulate LO expression. New, LO-like genes have also been identified and cloned, suggesting the existence of a multigene family. It has also become increasingly evident that LO may have other important biological functions in addition to its role in the crosslinking of elastin and collagen in the extracellular matrix.},

abstract = {The in vitro oxidation of tryptophan (Trp) by pro-oxidant systems such as iron-ascorbate indicates that Trp is a target for oxygen radicals in vivo. The Trp in albumin and lipoproteins has been reported to be actively oxidized by hydroxyl radical (HO(*)) generating systems such as copper-ascorbate or PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids) respectively. The super-physiological concentrations of the oxidants used in these studies prompted us to examine the effect of low copper and ascorbate concentrations on Trp oxidation. Trp (10-5000 mumol/L) was incubated with 1.5 mumol/L copper plus ascorbate (0.113 and 1.13 mmol/L) at 37 degrees C and its oxidation followed by fluorescence and high-performance liquid chromatography. The percentage of Trp oxidized by the ascorbate-copper system was inversely related to its concentration and positively related to the ascorbate concentration. High concentrations of Trp (above 50 mumol/L for 0.113 mmol/L and 500 mumol/L for 1.13 mmol/L ascorbate) are not significantly oxidized in the presence of ascorbate. The large drop in the percentage Trp oxidation at higher concentrations may be due to the chelation of copper by Trp. High concentrations of Trp (over 50 mumol/L) strongly prevented ascorbate oxidation by copper, and therefore inhibited the production of HO(*) needed for Trp oxidation. Protein Trp is less readily oxidized by the ascorbate-copper system than free Trp. Proteins chelate copper much better than Trp, and so inhibit its oxidative activity, at least against ascorbic acid.},

abstract = {One-day-old broiler chicks were adapted to a basal, isolated soyprotein-cornstarch diet containing 20% protein, 0.59% methionine and 3,300 kcal metabolizable energy (ME)/kg. They were then fed experimental diets consisting of three levels (0, 500, 1,000 ppm) of copper added to each of the basal diet plus four levels (0, 0.4, 0.8, or 1.5%) of L-methionine for 1 or 4 weeks. Growth was retarded after 1 week by all levels of supplementary methionine, and by 500 or 1,000 ppm excess copper. The plasma concentrations of free methionine, serine, alpha-aminobutyric acid and cystathionine were increased by excess dietary methionine. Excess copper prevented the increase in plasma methionine. After 4 weeks, the plasma methionine concentration and rate of growth of chicks fed 0.4% excess L-methionine did not differ significantly from basal values. The growth retardation caused by 500 ppm excess copper was alleviated by 0.4% supplemental methionine, and the elevations in plasma methionine and liver and spleen iron concentrations observed in chicks fed 1.5% excess methionine were reduced by 1,000 ppm excess copper. The patterns of the relationship between dietary methionine and liver or spleen iron, in the presence or absence of supplementary copper, were similar to those between dietary and free plasma methionine.},

abstract = {Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is activated by its natural ligand, mediating multiple essential biological processes. Copper (II) ions are bioactive ions and are crucial in the regulation of cell signaling pathway. However, the crosstalk between copper (II) ions and RTK-mediated cellular signaling remains unclear. Herein, we reported the effect of copper (II) ions on the ligand-independent RTK cellular signaling pathway. Our results indicate that both EGFR and MET signaling were activated by copper (II) in the absence of the corresponding ligands, EGF and HGF, respectively. Consequently, copper (II) ions initiate two RTK-mediated downstream signal transductions, including AKT and ERK. Moreover, copper (II) significantly increased proliferation and cellular migration. Our study proposes a novel role of copper in RTK-mediated signaling for growth factor-independent cancer cell proliferation and migration, implying that targeting both the copper (II) and growth factor in tumor microenvironments may be necessary for cancer treatment.},

abstract = {Ceruloplasmin (Cp) is a multicopper oxidase with ferroxidase properties being of importance to the mobilisation and export of iron from cells and its ability to bind copper. In ageing humans, Cp deficiency is known to result in aceruloplasminemia, which among other is characterised by neurological symptoms. To obtain novel information about the functions of Cp in the central nervous system (CNS) we compared the brain proteome in forebrains from asymptomatic 4-6-month-old Cp-deficient (B6N(Cg)-Cp(tm1b(KOMP)Wtsi) /J) and wild-type mice. Of more than 5600 quantified proteins, 23 proteins, were regulated, whereas more than 1200 proteins had regulated post-translational modifications (PTMs). The genes of the regulated proteins, glycoproteins and phosphoproteins appeared mostly to be located to neurons and oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Cp deficiency especially affected the function of proteins involved in the extension of neuronal projections, synaptic signalling and cellular mRNA processing and affected the expression of proteins involved in neurodegenerative disease and diabetes. Iron concentration and transferrin saturation were reduced in the blood of even younger, 3- to 5-month-old, Cp-deficient mice. Iron act as cofactor in many enzymatic processes and reactions. Changes in iron availability and oxidation as consequence of Cp deficiency could therefore affect the synthesis of proteins and lipids. This proteomic characterisation is to our knowledge the first to document the changes taking place in the CNS-proteome and its phosphorylation and glycosylation state in Cp-deficient mice.},

abstract = {Catalytic quinone cofactors derived from posttranslational modification of amino acid residues within the enzyme polypeptide have roles in a variety of biological processes ranging from metabolism in bacteria to inflammation and connective tissue maturation in humans. In recent years, studies of the biosynthesis of one of these cofactors, tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ), have provided examples of novel chemistry that is required for the generation of these protein-derived cofactors. A novel c-type diheme enzyme, MauG, catalyzes a six-electron oxidation that completes TTQ biosynthesis in a 119-kDa protein substrate. The posttranslational modification reactions proceed via an unprecedented Fe(V) equivalent catalytic intermediate comprised of two hemes; one an Fe(IV)=O and the other a six-coordinate Fe(IV) with axial ligands provided by amino acid residues. This high valent diheme species is an alternative to Compound I, an Fe(IV)=O heme with a porphyrin or amino acid cation radical, which is typically the reactive intermediate of heme-dependent oxygenases and peroxidases.},

abstract = {Background: Collagen cross-linking is mediated by lysyl oxidase (LOX) enzyme in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of mitral valve leaflets. Alterations in collagen content and LOX protein expression in the ECM of degenerative mitral valve may enhance leaflet expansion and disease severity. Methods: Twenty posterior degenerative mitral valve leaflets from patients with severe mitral regurgitation were obtained at surgery. Five normal posterior mitral valve leaflets procured during autopsy served as controls. Valvular interstitial cells (VICs) density was quantified by immunohistochemistry, collagen types I and III by picro-sirius red staining and immunohistochemistry, and proteoglycans by alcian blue staining. Protein expression of LOX and its mediator TGF1 were quantified by immunofluorescence and gene expression by PCR. Results: VICs density was increased, structural type I collagen density was reduced, while reparative type III collagen and proteoglycan densities were increased (p<0.0001) with an increase in spongiosa layer thickness in myxomatous valves. These changes were associated with a reduction in LOX (p<0.0001) and increase in TGF1 protein expression (p<0.0001). However, no significant change was seen in gene expression. Linear regression analysis identified a correlation between type I collagen density and LOX grade (R2=0.855; p<0.0001). Conclusions: Reduced type I collagen density with a simultaneous increase in type III collagen and proteoglycan densities possibly contributes to spongiosa layer expansion resulting in incompetent mitral valve leaflets. Observed changes in type I and III collagen densities in DMVD may be secondary to alterations in LOX protein expression, contributing to disorganization of ECM and disease severity.},

abstract = {Changes in speciation of copper(II) in reactions with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and gallic acid (GA) as a function of pH have been investigated by multifrequency (X- and S-band) EPR spectroscopy in the fluid and frozen states. The EPR spectra show the formation of three distinct mononuclear species with each of the polyphenols, and these are interpreted in terms of one mono- and two bis-complexes. However, di- or polymeric complexes dominate the Cu(II) speciation in the pH range 48, and it is only at alkaline pH values that these mononuclear complexes make appreciable contributions to the metal speciation. Each mononuclear complex displays linewidth anisotropy in fluid solution as a consequence of incomplete averaging of the spin Hamiltonian parameters through molecular motion. Rotational correlation times for the individual complexes have been estimated by analysing the lineshape anisotropy of the fluid solution spectra using parameters determined by simulation of the rigid limit spectra. These show that the molecular masses increase with increasing pH, indicating either coordination of increasing numbers of polyphenol molecules as ligands to the copper or the increasing involvement of polyphenol dimers as ligands in the copper coordination sphere.},

abstract = {Speciation can provide knowledge about absorption, reactivity to binding sites, bioavailability, toxicity, and excretion of elements. In this study, the speciation of copper in different model solutions under the influence of gastrointestinal (GI) pH was studied by ion selective electrode (ISE) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES). It was found that the electrode response (mV) against Cu2+ decreased with the increase in pH and dropped to the lowest point at pH 7.5 in all model solutions. When amino acids and organic acids were present, the ratio of filtered copper (0.45m, pH 7.5) was more than 90%. When casein was present, whey protein, pancreatin, and starch were added, and the ratio of filtered copper was 85.60.3, 56.78.8, 38.55.1, and 1.00.3%, respectively. When there is not enough organic ligand, excessive copper will form copper hydroxide precipitation with the increase in pH, but it got the highest electrode response (mV) against Cu2+. From this study, it can be concluded that the speciation of copper in GI tract is strongly influenced by the pH and the composition of food. When there are few ligands coexisting in the GI tract, the concentration of copper ion may be relatively high.},

abstract = {Copper is an essential trace metal element that significantly affects human physiology and pathology by regulating various important biological processes, including mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, iron mobilization, connective tissue crosslinking, antioxidant defense, melanin synthesis, blood clotting, and neuron peptide maturation. Increasing lines of evidence obtained from studies of cell culture, animals, and human genetics have demonstrated that dysregulation of copper metabolism causes heart disease, which is the leading cause of mortality in the US. Defects of copper homeostasis caused by perturbed regulation of copper chaperones or copper transporters or by copper deficiency resulted in various types of heart disease, including cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes mellitus cardiomyopathy. This review aims to provide a timely summary of the effects of defective copper homeostasis on heart disease and discuss potential underlying molecular mechanisms.},

abstract = {Background: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a life-threatening heart disease and a common cause of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction and subsequent left or biventricular dilatation. A significant number of cases have a genetic etiology; however, as a complex disease, the exact genetic risk factors are largely unknown, and many patients remain without a molecular diagnosis. Methods: We performed GWAS followed by whole-genome, transcriptome, and immunohistochemical analyses in a spontaneously occurring canine model of DCM. Canine gene discovery was followed up in three human DCM cohorts. Results: Our results revealed two independent additive loci associated with the typical DCM phenotype comprising left ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilatation. We highlight two novel candidate genes, RNF207 and PRKAA2, known for their involvement in cardiac action potentials, energy homeostasis, and morphology. We further illustrate the distinct genetic etiologies underlying the typical DCM phenotype and ventricular premature contractions. Finally, we followed up on the canine discoveries in human DCM patients and discovered candidate variants in our two novel genes. Conclusions: Collectively, our study yields insight into the molecular pathophysiology of DCM and provides a large animal model for preclinical studies.

abstract = {Animals that are copper deficient have cardiac hypertrophy where there is a dramatic increase in mitochondria. Mitochondrial biogenesis is enhanced in this model and there is an upregulation of mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA) and nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 (NRF-1 and NRF-2). While the cuproenzyme, cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), is an attractive candidate to explain the connection between cardiac hypertrophy in copper deficiency and subsequent mitochondrial biogenesis, studies have revealed that ATP synthase may be impacted by copper depletion. NRF-1 and NRF-2 can bind to some of the subunits of both CCO and ATP synthase to regulate gene expression. Furthermore, oxidative phosphorylation appears to occur unaltered in the copper-deficient state. Copper-deficient mitochondria appear to be less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of oligomycin compared to controls. Decreases in the delta subunit protein and beta mRNA transcript have been reported for ATP synthase as a function of copper deficiency. The limited data available suggest that copper, either indirectly or directly, alters ATP synthase function.},

abstract = {Background: Hypothyroidism is a commonly diagnosed endocrinopathy in dogs. This study aimed to investigate the frequency and risk factors for diagnosis of hypothyroidism in UK primary-care practice. Dogs diagnosed with hypothyroidism were identified by searching electronic patient records of primary-care practices participating in VetCompass. A cohort study design estimated one-year (2016) period prevalence and incidence risk for hypothyroidism. Multivariable binary logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations between demographic risk factors and hypothyroidism. Results: From 905,553 dogs, 2,105 dogswere recorded with diagnosed hypothyroidism in 2016; 359 incident and 1,746 pre-existing, giving an annual prevalence of 0.23% (95% CI 0.220.24) andannual incidence risk of 0.04% (95% CI 0.040.04). Multivariable logistic regression identified 24 predisposed and nine protected breeds. Standard Doberman pinscher (odds ratio [OR]=17.02, 95% CI 12.822.64), Tibetan terrier (11.25, 95% CI 8.2715.32) and boxer (10.44, 95% CI 8.6612.58) breeds showed high predisposition. Pug (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.090.89), Yorkshire terrier (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.240.59), Shih-tzu (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.230.64) and Jack Russell terrier (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.290.54) were the most protected breeds. Overall, being a purebred dog, being insured, having bodyweight above the breed-sex mean, increasing age, being neuteredand rising adult bodyweight also showed increased odds being a dog living with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Conclusions: Several strong breed predispositions for diagnosis of hypothyroidism were identified that can assist with disorder prioritisation in ongoingefforts to improve breed health. Other risk factors were also identified that can assist veterinary surgeons during clinical work-up of suspected cases. Identification of novel evidence for protected breeds provides useful information for research into genetic mechanisms.},

abstract = {Background: Trace metals are essential trace elements for the human body, but insufficient or excessive levels of metal ions can lead to the development of disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between dietary intake of copper and the prevalence of kidney stones in U.S. adult population. Methods: We included data on dietary intake of trace metals from 28,623 adult participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database between 2007 and 2018. Multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) dose-response curves were used to explore the association between trace metals and kidney stones, and 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was performed between the stone formers and non-stone formers to test the validity of the results. Results: Dose-response curves showed a non-linear negative association between dietary copper intake and kidney stones, and an increase in copper intake reduced the risk of kidney stones. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for kidney stones in each quartile of copper intake compared to the lowest quartile were 0.905 (0.8081.011, p = 0.075), 0.880 (0.7850.987, p = 0.028) and 0.853 (0.7560.959, p = 0.009). In addition, similar conclusions were reached after analysis of PSM in the stone formers and non-stone formers groups. Conclusion: Dietary copper intake was negatively and non-linearly correlated with kidney stones, which is worthy of further research and application in clinical practice.},

abstract = {Several clinical observations have suggested that copper (Cu) plays a role in regulating haematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) development. To further study this role we used an ex vivo system. Cord blood-derived CD34+ cells were cultured in liquid medium supplemented with Kit- ligand, FLt3, interleukin 6 (IL-6), thrombopoietin and IL-3. Under these conditions, Cu content, measured by atomic absorption, was 7 ng/10(7) cells. Modulation of intracellular Cu was achieved by supplementing the cultures with the Cu chelator tetraethylenepentamine, which reduced cellular Cu (4 ng/10(7) cells), or ceruloplasmin or Cu sulphate that elevated cellular Cu (18 and 14 ng/10(7) cells respectively). The results indicated that low Cu content delayed differentiation, as measured by the surface antigens CD34, CD14 and CD15, colony-forming unit (CFU) frequency and cell morphology, while high Cu accelerated differentiation compared with Cu unmanipulated cultures. As a result, expansion of total cells, CFU and CD34+ cells in low Cu was extended (12-16 weeks), and in high Cu was shortened (2-4 weeks), compared with control cultures (6-8 weeks). These effects required modulation of intracellular Cu only during the first 1-3 weeks of the culture; the long-term effects persisted thereafter, suggesting that the decision process for either self-renewal or differentiation is taken early during the culture. This novel method of controlling cell proliferation and differentiation by copper and copper chelators might be utilized for ex vivo manipulation of HPC for various clinical applications.},

abstract = {Copper (Cu) is an essential metal required for activity of a number of redox active enzymes that participate in critical cellular pathways such as metabolism and cell signaling. Because it is also a toxic metal, Cu must be tightly controlled by a series of transporters and chaperone proteins that regulate Cu homeostasis. The critical nature of Cu is highlighted by the fact that mutations in Cu homeostasis genes cause pathologic conditions such as Menkes and Wilson diseases. While Cu homeostasis in highly affected tissues like the liver and brain is well understood, no study has probed the role of Cu in development of skeletal muscle, another tissue that often shows pathology in these conditions. Here, we found an increase in whole cell Cu content during differentiation of cultured immortalized or primary myoblasts derived from mouse satellite cells. We demonstrate that Cu is required for both proliferation and differentiation of primary myoblasts. We also show that a key Cu homeostasis gene, Atp7a, undergoes dynamic changes in expression during myogenic differentiation. Alternative polyadenylation and stability of Atp7a mRNA fluctuates with differentiation stage of the myoblasts, indicating post-transcriptional regulation of Atp7a that depends on the differentiation state. This is the first report of a requirement for Cu during myogenic differentiation and provides the basis for understanding the network of Cu transport associated with myogenesis.},

abstract = {AIMS: In high doses zinc may cause copper deficiency, a diagnosis that is often missed resulting in anaemia, neutropenia and irreversible neurological symptoms. The aim of this study was to assess if zinc deficiency is erroneously diagnosed by misinterpretation of plasma zinc concentrations and whether copper deficiency is induced in patients prescribed zinc. METHODS: Casenotes of 70 patients prescribed zinc were scrutinised. Plasma concentrations of zinc, copper, C reactive protein and albumin were recorded from the laboratory database. RESULTS: 62% of patients were prescribed zinc at doses sufficient to cause copper deficiency. In 48% of the patients, plasma zinc concentrations were low as a probable result of hypoalbuminaemia or the systemic inflammatory response rather than deficiency. Awareness of copper deficiency was lacking; it was only documented as a possible side effect in one patient and plasma copper was measured in only two patients prescribed zinc. 9% of patients developed unexplained anaemia and 7% developed neurological symptoms typical of copper deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Zinc deficiency is frequently misdiagnosed on the basis of low plasma zinc concentrations. The potential risk of copper deficiency developing in patients prescribed high doses of zinc is apparently infrequently considered. It is probable that a significant minority of patients prescribed with high doses of zinc develop iatrogenic copper deficiency.},

abstract = {Dietary cholesterol causes atherosclerosis along with a reduction of copper concentrations in the atherosclerosis wall. This study was to determine the relationship between aorta copper concentrations and the severity of atherosclerotic lesions as well as copper homeostasis in multiple organs in cholesterol-fed rabbits. Male New Zealand white rabbits, 10-week-old and averaged 2.0 kg, were fed a diet containing 1% (w/w) cholesterol or the same diet without cholesterol as controls. Twelve weeks after the feeding, aortic atherosclerotic lesions, serum cholesterol, and multiple organ copper concentrations were measured. Compared to controls, rabbits fed cholesterol-supplemented diet displayed higher serum cholesterol levels and developed atherosclerosis. Copper concentrations in the cholesterol-fed rabbits were increased in the serum and kidney but decreased in the atherosclerosis wall and multiple organs, including heart, liver, spleen, and lung. Furthermore, aorta copper concentrations negatively correlated, respectively, with the severity of the atherosclerotic lesion (r = - 0.64, p = 0.01), the microscope atherosclerotic lesion area (r = - 0.60, p = 0.02), and the stenosis of the lumen (r = - 0.54, p = 0.04). Dietary cholesterol not only causes atherosclerosis but also disturbs copper homeostasis in multiple organ systems. The negative correlation between aorta copper concentrations and the severity of atherosclerotic lesions suggests a vicious cycle between copper reduction and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. These changes in copper homeostasis would be additive to atherosclerosis as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in humans.},

abstract = {HYPOTHESIS AND PREDICTIONS: Here, we claim that amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation is a protective mechanism that ultimately fails. We predict that more Abeta accumulates in regions with higher rates of glucose metabolism, reaching a maximum followed by progression of pathology. BACKGROUND: Abeta accumulation is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) but the accumulation does not correlate with cognitive decline, unlike the rates of glucose metabolism. STRATEGY: We compared averaged and individual estimates of regional binding potentials of [(11) C]Pittsburgh compound B to regionally averaged and individual values of metabolism of [(18) F]fluorodeoxyglucose in brain regions of volunteers with AD. SIGNIFICANCE: The claim explains the cognitive decline in some patients at a significantly lower level of Abeta deposition than in other patients, as well as the presence of cognitively healthy individuals with high Abeta accumulation. With further support of the hypothesis, the significance of Abeta accumulation in brains of patients with AD may require revision.},

abstract = {Copper toxicosis is frequently encountered in various dog breeds. A number of differences and similarities occur between Wilson disease and copper toxicosis in Bedlington terriers, caused by a mutation in the COMMD1 gene, and copper toxicosis in Labrador retrievers, caused by mutations in both ATP7A and ATP7B gene. First the specific population structure of dog breeds is explained with reference to its applicability for genetic investigations. The relatively large body size (variable from less than 1 kg to over 50 kg) and life-span (over 10 years) of dogs facilitates preclinical studies on safety on long-term effects of novel procedures. Then copper toxicosis in the two dog breeds is described in detail with an emphasis on the functions of the causative proteins. Some of the advantages of this species for preclinical studies are described with an example of liver stem cell transplantations in COMMD1 deficient dogs. Since the genetic background of copper toxicosis in other dogs breeds has not yet been elucidated, it is conceivable that novel copper-related gene products or modifier genes will be discovered. About a century after the Novel prize was awarded to the research on dogs (Pavlov), dogs are in spotlight again as important preclinical model animals.},

abstract = {Simple Summary: This work compiles the current state of knowledge regarding zinc requirements of healthy dogs and biomarkers of zinc status. To ensure an adequate zinc status, it is important to know the zinc content of foods and their bioavailability to assess the need and the ideal supplementation strategy regarding levels and sources of additives in complete dog foods. As zinc is required for enzymatic, structural, and regulatory functions in the animal body, its nutritional status has been associated with several pathologies that may be due to, or exacerbated by, a deficit of dietary zinc supply. Abstract: Zinc is an essential trace element, required for enzymatic, structural, and regulatory functions. As body reserves are scarce, an adequate zinc status relies on proper dietary supply and efficient homeostasis. Several biomarkers have been proposed that enable the detection of poor zinc status, but more sensitive and specific ones are needed to detect marginal deficiencies. The zinc content of commercial dry dog foods has great variability, with a more frequent non-compliance with the maximum authorized limit than with the nutritional requirement. The bioavailability of dietary zinc also plays a crucial role in ensuring an adequate zinc status. Despite controversial results, organic zinc sources have been considered more bioavailable than inorganic sources, albeit the zinc source effect is more evident after a restriction period of dietary zinc. Many disorders have been associated with inadequate zinc status, not being clear whether the occurrence of the disease is the consequence or the cause. This review presents data on zinc requirements and biomarkers for zinc status, that can be applied for the development of supplementation strategies of zinc in complete pet foods. Moreover, it provides an understanding of the role zinc plays in the health of dogs, and how altered zinc status affects diseases in dogs.},

Diagnosis depends primarily on clinical features, biochemical parameters and the presence of the Kayser-Fleischer ring. Genetic analysis for mutations within ATP7B is a convincing diagnostic tool. The traditional treatment for WD includes chelation of excessive copper accumulation and reduction of copper intake. Medical therapy is effective but WD is not yet curable. Liver transplantation is especially helpful for patients who fail to respond to medical therapy or present with fulminant liver failure, although evaluation of its long-term effect are still in need.},

abstract = {Ceruloplasmin is a plasma protein that functions as a copper transporter. Epidemiological studies have indicated an association between the concentration of this protein and risk for cardiovascular disease. The mechanism for the involvement of ceruloplasmin in cardiovascular disease and other conditions is not yet clear, although it is widely accepted that the role played by ceruloplasmin in facilitating or counteracting oxidative stress is central. We review here some of the studies on this issue and try to calm down the duel between the claims supporting the oxidant or the antioxidant effects of ceruloplasmin through a clear-cut analysis of the available data. Our conclusion is that a verdict regarding the pathogenetic involvement of ceruloplasmin in cardiovascular disease should await further research.},

abstract = {Copper is essential for normal growth and development of human organisms. The role of copper as a cofactor of important metabolic enzymes, such as cytochrome c oxidase, superoxide dismutase, lysyl oxidase, dopamine--hydroxylase, and many others, has been well established. In recent years, new regulatory roles of copper have emerged. Accumulating evidence points to the involvement of copper in lipid metabolism, antimicrobial defense, neuronal activity, resistance of tumor cells to platinum-based chemotherapeutic drugs, kinase-mediated signal transduction, and other essential cellular processes. For many of these processes, the precise mechanism of copper action remains to be established. Nevertheless, it is increasingly clear that many regulatory and signaling events are associated with changes in the intracellular localization and abundance of copper transporters, as well as distinct compartmentalization of copper itself. In this review, we discuss current data on regulation of the localization and abundance of copper transporters in response to metabolic and signaling events in human cells. Regulation by kinase-mediated phosphorylation will be addressed along with the emerging area of the redox-driven control of copper transport. We highlight mechanistic questions that await further testing.},

abstract = {The relationship between sarcopenia and the long-term risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) remains unclear. This study recruited a large prospective Caucasian cohort from the UK Biobank. Participants were assessed at baseline with handgrip strength and muscle mass and were categorized into groups of non-sarcopenia, probable sarcopenia, and confirmed sarcopenia. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model were used to explore the association between sarcopenia and the incidence of AF. The genetic predisposition of AF was assessed by polygenic risk score. Sensitivity analyses were performed to validate the results. A total of 384,433 participants with a median age of 58 years and 54.3% women were enrolled in this study. There were 24,007 cases of new-onset AF over a median follow-up of 12.56 years. The groups of non-sarcopenia, probable sarcopenia, and confirmed sarcopenia accounted for 22,290 (6.1%), 1665 (9.2%), and 52 (11.9%) cases, respectively. Compared with the non-sarcopenia group, participants with probable sarcopenia or confirmed sarcopenia had an 8% (95% CI, 1.03-1.14) or 61% (95% CI, 1.23-2.12) higher risk of AF incidence. The findings remained robust in multiple sensitivity analyses, such as subgroup analysis and further adjustment of genetic predisposition. Notably, the association between sarcopenia and a high AF risk was more pronounced in younger participants, women, and those with valvular heart disease. In conclusion, sarcopenia was associated with a high long-term risk of AF in Caucasians, supporting sarcopenia as a new independent risk factor of AF.},

abstract = {Of the seven amino acids required by Clostridium botulinum type E, tryptophan is the most essential and may provide the cell with nitrogen. The addition of excess tryptophan (10-20 mM) or other nitrogenous nutrients to minimal growth medium markedly decreased toxin formation but did not affect growth in C. botulinum type E. On the other hand, the addition of an enzymatic digest of casein (NZ Case) stimulated toxin formation and overcame repression by tryptophan. Immunoblots of proteins in culture fluids using antibodies to type E toxin indicated that tryptophan-repressed cultures produced less neurotoxin protein. Inhibitors of neurotoxin did not accumulate in cultures grown in minimal medium supplemented with high tryptophan. The results suggest that tryptophan availability in foods or in the intestine may be important for toxin formation by C. botulinum type E.},

abstract = {In manufacturing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), it is crucial to be able to predict how process conditions and supplements affect productivity and quality attributes, especially glycosylation. Supplemental inputs, such as amino acids and trace metals in the media, are reported to affect cell metabolism and glycosylation; quantifying their effects is essential for effective process development. We aim to present and validate, through a commercially relevant cell culture process, a technique for modeling such effects efficiently. While existing models can predict mAb production or glycosylation dynamics under specific process configurations, adapting them to new processes remains challenging, because it involves modifying the model structure and often requires some mechanistic understanding. Here, a modular modeling technique for adapting an existing model for a fed-batch Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture process without structural modifications or mechanistic insight is presented. Instead, data is used, obtained from designed experimental perturbations in media supplementation, to train and validate a supplemental input effect model, which is used to patch the existing model. The combined model can be used for model-based process development to improve productivity and to meet product quality targets more efficiently. The methodology and analysis are generally applicable to other CHO cell lines and cell types.},

abstract = {The high-affinity copper transporter CTR1 is encoded by CTR1 (SLC31A1), a gene locus for which no detailed genotype-phenotype correlations have previously been reported. We describe identical twin male infants homozygous for a novel missense variant NM_001859.4:c.284 G > A (p.Arg95His) in CTR1 with a distinctive autosomal recessive syndrome of infantile seizures and neurodegeneration, consistent with profound central nervous system copper deficiency. We used clinical, biochemical and molecular methods to delineate the first recognized examples of human CTR1 deficiency. These included clinical phenotyping, brain imaging, assays for copper, cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), and mitochondrial respiration, western blotting, cell transfection experiments, confocal and electron microscopy, protein structure modeling and fetal brain and cerebral organoid CTR1 transcriptome analyses. Comparison with two other critical mediators of cellular copper homeostasis, ATP7A and ATP7B, genes associated with Menkes disease and Wilson disease, respectively, revealed that expression of CTR1 was highest. Transcriptome analyses identified excitatory neurons and radial glia as brain cell types particularly enriched for copper transporter transcripts. We also assessed the effects of Copper Histidinate in the patients' cultured cells and in the patients, under a formal clinical protocol. Treatment normalized CCO activity and enhanced mitochondrial respiration in vitro, and was associated with modest clinical improvements. In combination with present and prior studies, these infants' clinical, biochemical and molecular phenotypes establish the impact of this novel variant on copper metabolism and cellular homeostasis and illuminate a crucial role for CTR1 in human brain development. CTR1 deficiency represents a newly defined inherited disorder of brain copper metabolism.},

abstract = {Copper serves as an essential cofactor for a variety of proteins in all living organisms. Previously, we described a human gene (CTR1;SLC31A1) that encodes a high-affinity copper-uptake protein and hypothesized that this protein is required for copper delivery to mammalian cells. Here, we test this hypothesis by inactivating the Ctr1 gene in mice by targeted mutagenesis. We observe early embryonic lethality in homozygous mutant embryos and a deficiency in copper uptake in the brains of heterozygous animals. Ctr1/ embryos can be recovered at E8.5 but are severely developmentally retarded and morphologically abnormal. Histological analysis reveals discontinuities and variable thickness in the basement membrane of the embryonic region and an imperfect Reichert's membrane, features that are likely due to lack of activity in the collagen cross-linking cupro-enzyme lysyl oxidase. A collapsed embryonic cavity, the absence of an allantois, retarded mesodermal migration, and increased cell death are also apparent. In the brains of heterozygous adult mice, which at 16 months are phenotypically normal, copper is reduced to approximately half compared with control littermates, implicating CTR1 as the required port for copper entry into at least this organ. A study of the spatial and temporal expression pattern of Ctr1 during mouse development and adulthood further shows that CTR1 is ubiquitously transcribed with highest expression observed in the specialized epithelia of the choroid plexus and renal tubules and in connective tissues of the eye, ovary, and testes. We conclude that CTR1 is the primary avenue for copper uptake in mammalian cells.},

abstract = {Articular cartilage remains among the most difficult tissues to regenerate due to its poor self-repair capacity. The lysyl oxidase family (LOX; also termed as protein-lysine 6-oxidase), mainly consists of lysyl oxidase (LO) and lysyl oxidase-like 1-4 (LOXL1-LOXL4), has been traditionally defined as cuproenzymes that are essential for stabilization of extracellular matrix, particularly cross-linking of collagen and elastin. LOX is essential in the musculoskeletal system, particularly cartilage. LOXs-mediated collagen cross-links are essential for the functional integrity of articular cartilage. Appropriate modulation of the expression or activity of certain LOX members selectively may become potential promising strategy for cartilage repair. In the current review, we summarized the advances of LOX in cartilage homeostasis and functioning, as well as copper-mediated activation of LOX through hypoxia-responsive signaling axis during recent decades. Also, the molecular signaling network governing LOX expression has been summarized, indicating that appropriate modulation of hypoxia-responsive-signaling-directed LOX expression through manipulation of bioavailability of copper and oxygen is promising for further clinical implications of cartilage regeneration, which has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach for cartilage rejuvenation in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Therefore, targeted regulation of copper-mediated hypoxia-responsive signalling axis for selective modulation of LOX expression may become potential effective therapeutics for enhanced cartilage regeneration and rejuvenation in future clinical implications.},

abstract = {This retrospective study included 222 dogs suspected to have tracheal collapse (TC) and examined between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2015. Fluoroscopic and radiographic images and medical records were evaluated to investigate the fluoroscopic characteristics of TC and cervical lung herniation (CLH), and to determine their relationships to various influencing. Grade of TC, existence of tracheal kinking, location of CLH (right or left side), and grade of CLH were evaluated fluoroscopically. One hundred ninety-nine dogs (89.6%) were diagnosed with TC. Presence of TC was not associated with the patients' cough history; however, CLH was positively correlated with cough history (odds ratio [OR], 2.896; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.556 to 5.390) and was affected by tracheal kinking (OR, 3.841; 95% CI, 1.884 to 7.831). Chronic cough was not related with CLH. Since TC can be observed in patients without a history of cough, presence of TC should be ruled out by using physical examination and diagnostic imaging. Although CLH is associated with a history of cough, it is a common appearance in dogs, and transient coughing can elicit CLH in patients without a history of cough.},

abstract = {Elevated levels of homocysteine (Hcy) (known as hyperhomocysteinemia HHcy) are involved in dilated cardiomyopathy. Hcy chelates copper and impairs copper-dependent enzymes. Copper deficiency has been linked to cardiovascular disease. We tested the hypothesis that copper supplement regresses left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction in pressure overload DCM mice hearts. The mice were grouped as sham, sham + Cu, aortic constriction (AC), and AC + Cu. Aortic constriction was performed by transverse aortic constriction. The mice were treated with or without 20 mg/kg copper supplement in the diet for 12 weeks. The cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and electrocardiography. The matrix remodeling was assessed by measuring matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), and lysyl oxidase (LOX) by Western blot analyses. The results suggest that in AC mice, cardiac function was improved with copper supplement. TIMP-1 levels decreased in AC and were normalized in AC + Cu. Although MMP-9, TIMP-3, and LOX activity increased in AC and returned to baseline value in AC + Cu, copper supplement showed no significant effect on TIMP-4 activity after pressure overload. In conclusion, our data suggest that copper supplement helps improve cardiac function in a pressure overload dilated cardiomyopathic heart.},

abstract = {The trace element copper is indispensable for all aerobic life forms. Its ability to cycle between two oxidation states, Cu1+ and Cu2+, has been harnessed by a wide array of metalloenzymes that catalyze electron transfer reactions. The metabolic needs for copper are sustained by a complex series of transporters and carrier proteins that regulate its intracellular accumulation and distribution in both pathogenic microbes and their animal hosts. However, copper is also potentially toxic due in part to its ability to generate reactive oxygen species. Recent studies suggest that the macrophage phagosome accumulates copper during bacterial infection, which may constitute an important mechanism of killing. Bacterial countermeasures include the up-regulation of copper export and detoxification genes during infection, which studies suggest are important determinants of virulence. In this minireview, we summarize recent developments that suggest an emerging role for copper as an unexpected component in determining the outcome of host-pathogen interactions.},

abstract = {Copper is an essential micronutrient for both pathogens and the animal hosts they infect. However, copper can also be toxic in cells due to its redox properties and ability to disrupt active sites of metalloproteins, such as Fe-S enzymes. Through these toxic properties, copper is an effective antimicrobial agent and an emerging concept in innate immunity is that the animal host intentionally exploits copper toxicity in antimicrobial weaponry. In particular, macrophages can attack invading microbes with high copper and this metal is also elevated at sites of lung infection. In addition, copper levels in serum rise during infection with a wide array of pathogens. To defend against this toxic copper, the microbial intruder is equipped with a battery of copper detoxification defenses that promote survival in the host, including copper exporting ATPases and copper binding metallothioneins. However, it is important to remember that copper is also an essential nutrient for microbial pathogens and serves as important cofactor for enzymes such as cytochrome c oxidase for respiration, superoxide dismutase for anti-oxidant defense and multi-copper oxidases that act on metals and organic substrates. We therefore posit that the animal host can also thwart pathogen growth by limiting their copper nutrients, similar to the well-documented nutritional immunity effects for starving microbes of essential zinc, manganese and iron micronutrients. This review provides both sides of the copper story and evaluates how the host can exploit either copper-the-toxin or copper-the-nutrient in antimicrobial tactics at the host-pathogen battleground.},

abstract = {As an essential nutrient, coppers redox properties are both beneficial and toxic to cells. Therefore, leveraging the characteristics of copper-dependent diseases or using copper toxicity to treat copper-sensitive diseases may offer new strategies for specific disease treatments. In particular, copper concentration is typically higher in cancer cells, making copper a critical limiting nutrient for cancer cell growth and proliferation. Hence, intervening in copper metabolism specific to cancer cells may become a potential tumor treatment strategy, directly impacting tumor growth and metastasis. In this review, we discuss the metabolism of copper in the body and summarize research progress on the role of copper in promoting tumor cell growth or inducing programmed cell death in tumor cells. Additionally, we elucidate the role of copper-related drugs in cancer treatment, intending to provide new perspectives for cancer treatment.},

It was generated from expert opinion and information gathered from searching of PubMed for manuscripts on CH, the Veterinary Information Network for abstracts and conference proceeding from annual meetings of the American College of Veterinary Medicine and the European College of Veterinary Medicine, and selected manuscripts from the human literature on CH. The panel recognizes that the diagnosis and treatment of CH in the dog is a complex process that requires integration of clinical presentation with clinical pathology, diagnostic imaging, and hepatic biopsy. Essential to this process is an index of suspicion for CH, knowledge of how to best collect tissue samples, access to a pathologist with experience in assessing hepatic histopathology, knowledge of reasonable medical interventions, and a strategy for monitoring treatment response and complications.},

abstract = {An attempt was made to study the effect of taurine on the toxicity of copper in male Wistar rats. The rats were divided into eight groups and fed different diets with or without supplement of 5% taurine and 150-600 ppm copper for 2 months. It was found that the levels of copper and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver, and the activities of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) in the plasma of rats were increased with the increasing dose of copper. However, the levels of copper and MDA, and the enzyme activities of AST and ALT in the rats fed with supplement of taurine were significantly lower than in the rats fed without supplement of taurine. The level of copper in the faeces of rats treated with taurine and copper was higher than that of rats treated with copper alone. It indicated that taurine might play a role in reducing the toxic effect of copper in rats.},

Concentrations of copper (Cu) in soil and forage from affected and unaffected areas were similar and within the normal range, but concentrations of sulfur (S) in soil and forage were significantly higher (P < 0.01) in affected than in unaffected areas. Concentrations of Cu in blood, hair, and liver from the affected Przewalskis gazelles were significantly lower (P < 0.01) than those in healthy animals. Affected Przewalskis gazelles showed a hypochromic microcytic anemia and a low level of ceruloplasmin. Oral administration of copper sulphate (CuSO4) prevented and cured the disease. We conclude that the disorder of Przewalskis gazelles was caused by secondary Cu deficiency, mainly due to high S content in forage.},

abstract = {Background:: Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) refers to a condition in which structural integrity of cartilaginous wall of trachea is lost. Excessive dynamic airway collapse (EDAC) is characterized by excessive invagination of posterior wall of trachea. In both these conditions, airway lumen gets compromised, especially during expiration, which can lead to symptoms such as breathlessness, cough, and wheezing. Both these conditions can be present in obstructive lung diseases; TBM due to chronic airway inflammation and EDAC due to dynamic compressive forces during expiration. The present study was planned with the hypothesis that TBM/EDAC could also produce expiratory wheeze in patients with obstructive airway disorders. Hence, prevalence and factors affecting presence of this entity in patients with obstructive airway diseases were the aims and objectives of this study. Materials and Methods:: Twenty-five patients with obstructive airway disorders (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] or bronchial asthma), who were stable on medical management, but having persistent expiratory wheezing, were included in the study. They were evaluated for TBM/EDAC by bronchoscopy and computed tomographic scan of chest. The presence of TBM/EDAC was correlated with variables including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking index, level of dyspnea, and severity of disease. Results:: Mean age of the patients was 62.7 7.81 years. Out of 25 patients, 14 were males. TBM/EDAC was found in 40% of study subjects. Age, sex, BMI, severity of disease, frequency of exacerbations and radiological findings etc., were not found to have any association with presence of TBM/EDAC. Conclusion:: TBM/EDAC is common in patients with obstructive airway disorders and should be evaluated in these patients, especially with persistent expiratory wheezing as diagnosis of this entity could provide another treatment option in these patients with persistent symptoms despite medical management.},

abstract = {Copper is essential for life processes like energy metabolism, reactive oxygen species detoxification, iron uptake, and signaling in eukaryotic organisms. Mitochondria gather copper for the assembly of cuproenzymes such as the respiratory complex IV, cytochrome c oxidase, and the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 1. In this regard, copper plays a role in mitochondrial function and signaling involving bioenergetics, dynamics, and mitophagy, which affect cell fate by means of metabolic reprogramming. In mammals, copper homeostasis is tightly regulated by the liver. However, cellular copper levels are tissue specific. Copper imbalances, either overload or deficiency, have been associated with many diseases, including anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, as well as tumor development and cancer aggressivity. Consistently, new pharmacological developments have been addressed to reduce or exacerbate copper levels as potential cancer therapies. This review goes over the copper source, distribution, cellular uptake, and its role in mitochondrial function, metabolic reprograming, and cancer biology, linking copper metabolism with the field of regenerative medicine and cancer.},

abstract = {Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has been in the literature and news because of the recent opinion-based journal articles and public releases by regulatory agencies. DCM is commonly associated with a genetic predisposition in certain dog breeds and can also occur secondary to other diseases and nutritional deficiencies. Recent communications in veterinary journals have discussed a potential relationship between grain-free and/or novel protein diets to DCM, citing a subjective increase in DCM in dog breeds that are not known to have a genetic predisposition for the disease. This literature review describes clinical presentations of DCM, common sequelae, treatment and preventative measures, histopathologic features, and a discussion of the varied etiological origins of the disease. In addition, current literature limitations are addressed, in order to ascertain multiple variables leading to the development of DCM. Future studies are needed to evaluate one variable at a time and to minimize confounding variables and speculation. Furthermore, to prevent sampling bias with the current FDA reports, the veterinary community should be asked to provide information for all cases of DCM in dogs. This should include cases during the same time period, regardless of the practitioners proposed etiology, due to no definitive association between diets with specific characteristics, such as, but not limited to, grain-free diets and those containing legumes, novel protein diets, and those produced by small manufacturers to DCM in dogs. In summary, in order to determine if certain ingredients, categories of diets, or manufacturing processes are related to an increased risk of DCM, further studies investigating these variables are necessary.},

abstract = {Hypothyroidism is a risk factor of heart failure (HF) in the general population. However, the relationship between hypothyroidism and clinical outcomes in patients with established HF is still inconclusive.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the association of hypothyroidism and all-cause mortality as well as cardiac death and/or hospitalization in patients with HF. We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases for studies of hypothyroidism and clinical outcomes in patients with HF published up to the end of January 2015. Random-effects models were used to estimate summary relative risk (RR) statistics. We included 13 articles that reported RR estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for hypothyroidism with outcomes in patients with HF. For the association of hypothyroidism with all-cause mortality and with cardiac death and/or hospitalization, the pooled RR was 1.44 (95% CI: 1.291.61) and 1.37 (95% CI: 1.221.55), respectively. However, the association disappeared on adjustment for B-type natriuretic protein level (RR 1.17, 95% CI: 0.901.52) and in studies of patients with mean age <65 years (RR 1.23, 95% CI: 0.881.76).We found hypothyroidism associated with increased all-cause mortality as well as cardiac death and/or hospitalization in patients with HF. Further diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for hypothyroidism may be needed for patients with HF.},

Patients present with symptoms such as chronic cough, dyspnoea and recurrent respiratory tract infections, which are often attributed to more common conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The term Flat Trachea Syndrome was first proposed by Niranjan and Marzouk in 2010 following a retrospective study of 28 patients with the condition who underwent surgery for it. The authors advocated the term due to the primary abnormality being collapse of the posterior membranous wall of the central airways as opposed to softening of the tracheal cartilage (tracheobronchomalacia), which they proposed is a misnomer. We present a rare case of a patient with flat trachea syndrome on a history of COPD who initially presented with recurrent respiratory tract infections.},

A transtracheal aspiration revealed highly cellular, serosanguineous fluid. Radiography revealed a patchy alveolar pattern and a narrowed tracheal lumen. Endoscopy confirmed narrowing of the tracheal lumen. Streptococcus zooepidemicus was isolated on culture of the transtracheal aspirate. The horse responded to penicillin treatment, and the tracheal collapse improved endoscopically after 4 days, with complete recovery within 1 year. Tracheal collapse has been reported to be a disease of older horses associated with degenerative cartilage. The findings in the horse of this report suggested that tracheal collapse may result from inflammation secondary to pneumonia and, therefore, may be reversible.},

abstract = {Canine tracheal collapse is a progressive disease in small breed dogs resulting from chronic inflammation of the tracheal mucosal lining. Polyunsaturated fatty acid EAB-277 is one of the nutraceuticals that can alleviate inflammation and oxidative stress. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a prognostic tool related to sympathovagal balance and oxidative stress level, which is widely used with cardiorespiratory diseases. However, the effect of EAB-277 on HRV in tracheal collapse dogs has rarely been investigated. In this study, 26 tracheal collapse dogs were divided into two groups. In the control group, the dogs received the standard treatment, whereas the dogs in the EAB-277 group received standard treatment combined with EAB-277. After being treated for 5 weeks, changes in radiographic findings, blood profiles, serum malondialdehyde, inflammatory markers, and HRV were evaluated. This study found that clinical signs were improved in both groups (p < 0.05). However, serum malondialdehyde (MDA), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) were decreased only in the EAB-277 group after treatment for five weeks (p < 0.05) and the mean percent change of MDA, IL-6, and TNF- at week five compared to baseline in the EAB-277 group was greater than in the control group (p < 0.05). Additionally, greater sympathovagal imbalance indicated by decreased standard deviation of all normal R-R intervals (SDNN) and standard deviation of the averaged R-R intervals for all 5-minutes segments (SDANN) was found in the control group at week five compared to baseline (P < 0.05), whereas EAB-277 improved SDNN and SDANN and decreased low frequency/high-frequency component (LF/HF ratio) after being treated for five weeks (P < 0.05). This study demonstrates that EAB-277 improves clinical signs and attenuates HRV impairment by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in tracheal collapse dogs.},

abstract = {In-stent restenosis can be caused by the activation, proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which affects long-term efficacy of interventional therapy. Copper (Cu) has been proved to accelerate the endothelialization and reduce thrombosis formation, but little is known about its inhibition effect on the excessive proliferation of VSMCs. In this study, 316L-Cu stainless steel and L605-Cu cobalt-based alloy with varying Cu content were fabricated and their effects on surface property, blood compatibility and VSMCs were studied in vitro and in vivo. CCK-8 assay and EdU assay indicated that the Cu-bearing metals had obvious inhibitory effect on proliferation of VSMCs. Blood clotting and hemolysis tests showed that the Cu-bearing metals had good blood compatibility. The inhibition effect of the Cu-bearing metals on migration of cells was detected by Transwell assay. Further studies showed that Cu-bearing metals significantly decreased the mRNA expressions of bFGF, PDGF-B, HGF, Nrf2, GCLC, GCLM, NQO1 and HO1. The phosphorylation of AKT and Nrf2 protein expressions in VSMCs were significantly decreased by Cu-bearing metals. Furthermore, it was also found that SC79 and TBHQ treatments could recover the protein expressions of phospho-AKT and Nrf2, and their downstream proteins as well. Moreover, 316L-Cu stent proved its inhibitory action on the proliferation of VSMCs in vivo. In sum, the results demonstrated that the Cu-bearing metals possessed apparent inhibitory effect on proliferation and migration of VSMCs via regulating the AKT/Nrf2/ARE pathway, showing the Cu-bearing metals as promising stent materials for long-term efficacy of implantation.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder impacting millions of people with cognitive impairment and affecting activities of daily living. The deposition of neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins and accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) are the main pathological characteristics of AD. However, the actual causal process of AD is not yet identified. Oxidative stress occurs prior to amyloid Abeta plaque formation and tau phosphorylation in AD. The role of master antioxidant, glutathione, and metal ions (e.g., iron) in AD are the frontline area of AD research. Iron overload in specific brain regions in AD is associated with the rate of cognitive decline. We have presented the outcome from various interventional trials involving iron chelators intended to minimize the iron overload in AD. To date, however, no significant positive outcomes have been reported using iron chelators in AD and warrant further research.},

abstract = {Tissue injury provokes a series of events containing inflammation, new tissue formation and tissue remodeling which are regulated by the spatially and temporally coordinated organization. It is an evolutionarily conserved, multi-cellular, multi-molecular process via complex signalling network. Tissue injury disorders present grievous clinical problems and are likely to increase since they are generally associated with the prevailing diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity. Although these dynamic responses vary not only for the different types of trauma but also for the different organs, a balancing act between the tissue degradation and tissue synthesis is the same. In this process, the degradation of old extracellular matrix (ECM) elements and new ones synthesis and deposition play an essential role, especially collagens. Lysyl oxidase (LOX) and four lysyl oxidase-like proteins are a group of enzymes capable of catalyzing cross-linking reaction of collagen and elastin, thus initiating the formation of covalent cross-links that insolubilize ECM proteins. In this way, LOX facilitates ECM stabilization through ECM formation, development, maturation and remodeling. This ability determines its potential role in tissue repair and regeneration. In this review, based on the current in vitro, animal and human in vivo studies which have shown the significant role of the LOXs in tissue repair, e.g., tendon regeneration, ligament healing, cutaneous wound healing, and cartilage remodeling, we focused on the role of the LOXs in inflammation phase, proliferation phase, and tissue remodeling phase of the repair process. By summarizing its healing role, we hope to shed light on the understanding of its potential in tissue repair and provide up to date therapeutic strategies towards related injuries.},

abstract = {Lysyl oxidase proteins (LOXs) are amine oxidases, which are mainly located in smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts and serve an important role in the formation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in a copper-dependent manner. Owing to the ability of LOX proteins to modulate crosslinking between collagens and to promote the deposition of other fibers, they serve crucially in organogenesis and the subsequent organ development, as well as disease initiation and progression. In addition, ECM formation significantly influences organ morphological formation in both cancer- and non-tumor-related diseases, in addition to cellular epigenetic transformation and migration, under the influence of LOXs. A number of different signaling pathways regulate the LOXs expression and their enzymatic activation. The tissue remodeling and transformation process shares some resemblance between oncogenesis and embryogenesis. Additionally the roles that LOXs serve appeared to be stressed during oncogenesis and tumor metastasis. It has also been indicated LOXs have a noteworthy role in non-tumor diseases. Nonetheless, the role of LOXs in systemic or local organ development and disease control remains unknown. In the present study, the essential roles that LOXs play in embryogenesis were unveiled partially, whereas the role of LOXs in organ or systematic development requires further investigations. The present review aimed to discuss the roles of members of the LOX family in the context of the remodeling of organogenesis and organ development. In addition, the consequences of the malfunction of these proteins related to the development of abnormalities and resulting diseases is discussed.},

abstract = {The varied reactions of the host to infection, inflammation, or trauma are collectively known as the acute-phase response and encompass a wide range of pathophysiological responses such as pyrexia, leukocytosis, hormone alterations, and muscle protein depletion combining to minimize tissue damage while enhancing the repair process. The mechanism for stimulation of hepatic production of acute-phase proteins is by proinflammatory cytokines. The functions of positive acute-phase proteins (APP) are regarded as important in optimization and trapping of microorganism and their products, in activating the complement system, in binding cellular remnants like nuclear fractions, in neutralizing enzymes, scavenging free hemoglobin and radicals, and in modulating the hosts immune response. APP can be used as diagnostic tool in many diseases like bovine respiratory syncytial virus, prostate cancer, bronchopneumonia, multiple myeloma, mastitis, Streptococcus suis infection, starvation, or lymphatic neoplasia. Thus, acute-phase proteins may provide an alternative means of monitoring animal health.},

abstract = {Ceruloplasmin (CP) is a multicopper oxidase and antioxidant that is mainly produced in the liver. CP not only plays a crucial role in the metabolic balance of copper and iron through its oxidase function but also exhibits antioxidant activity. In addition, CP is an acute-phase protein. In addition to being associated with aceruloplasminemia and neurodegenerative diseases such as Wilsons disease, Alzheimers disease, and Parkinsons disease, CP also plays an important role in metabolic diseases, which are caused by metabolic disorders and vigorous metabolism, mainly including diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, etc. Based on the physiological functions of CP, we provide an overview of the association of type 2 diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease, CP oxidative stress, inflammation, and metabolism of copper and iron. Studies have shown that metabolic diseases are closely related to systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and disorders of copper and iron metabolism. Therefore, we conclude that CP, which can reduce the formation of free radicals in tissues, can be induced during inflammation and infection, and can correct the metabolic disorder of copper and iron, has protective and diagnostic effects on metabolic diseases.},

abstract = {Ceruloplasmin (ferroxidase) is a copper-binding protein known to promote Fe2+ oxidation in plasma of mammals. Besides its classical ferroxidase activity, ceruloplasmin is known to catalyze the oxidation of various substrates, such as amines and catechols. Assays based on cyclic hydroxylamine oxidation are used to quantify and detect free radicals in biological samples ex vivo and in vitro. We show here that human ceruloplasmin promotes the oxidation of the cyclic hydroxylamine 1-hydroxy-3-carboxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine hydrochloride (CPH) and related probes in Chelex-treated phosphate buffer and rat serum. The reaction is suppressed by the metal chelators DTPA, EDTA and Desferal, while heparin and bathocuproine have no effect. Catalase or SOD additions do not interfere with the CPH-oxidation yield, demonstrating that free radicals are not involved in the CPH oxidation mediated by ceruloplasmin. Plasma samples immunodepleted of ceruloplasmin have lower levels of CPH oxidation, which confirms the role of ceruloplasmin (ferroxidase) as a biological oxidizing agent of cyclic hydroxylamines. In conclusion, we show that the ferroxidase activity of ceruloplasmin is a possible biological source of artifacts in the cyclic hydroxylamine-oxidation assay used for ROS detection and quantification.},

abstract = {Ceruloplasmin (CP) is the major copper transport protein in plasma, mainly produced by the liver. Glyco-sylphosphatidylinositol-linked CP (GPI-CP) is the predominant form expressed in astrocytes of the brain. A growing body of evidence has demonstrated that CP is an essential protein in the body with multiple functions such as regulating the home-ostasis of copper and iron ions, ferroxidase activity, oxidizing organic amines, and preventing the formation of free radicals. In addition, as an acute-phase protein, CP is induced during inflammation and infection. The fact that patients with genetic disorder aceruloplasminemia do not suffer from tissue copper deficiency, but rather from disruptions in iron metabolism shows essential roles of CP in iron metabolism rather than copper. Furthermore, abnormal metabolism of metal ions and ox-idative stress are found in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Wilsons disease, Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease. Brain iron accumulation and decreased activity of CP have been shown to be associated with neurodegeneration. We hypothesize that CP may play a protective role in neurodegenerative diseases. However, whether iron accumulation is a cause or a result of neurodegeneration remains unclear. Further research on molecular mechanisms is required before a con-sensus can be reached regarding a neuroprotective role for CP in neurodegeneration. This review article summarizes the main physiological functions of CP and the current knowledge of its role in neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Objective: To explore the effect of amyloid- peptide (A) on mandibular condyle to develop a new treatment for postmenopausal women with Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis. Methods: A murine bone loss model was established by ovariectomy. Microstructure parameters of the condyle were measured by microcomputed tomography before and after intraperitoneal injection with A. Flow cytometry, Alizarin red staining, RT-qPCR assays, FITC/PI staining, Oil Red O staining and western blotting were used to evaluate the effect of A on the osteogenic differentiation of mouse bone marrow stromal stem cells (mBMSCs). Results: In vivo, condylar microstructure parameters increased. Serum osteoprotegerin and procollagen type 1N propeptide increased in a dose-dependent manner after the injection of A, which were opposite the changes observed in c-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen, tumor necrosis factor- and the high serum level of leptin. In vitro, A promoted calcium nodule formation in the cells. The expression of ALP, Runx2, osteorix and osteocalcin increased significantly. The expression of mRNAs related to the Wnt signaling pathway was significantly upregulated, which could be blocked by DKK1. Conclusion: A can reverse bone loss in the mandibular condyle in ovariectomized mice through promoting the osteogenic differentiation of mBMSCs via the Wnt pathway.},

abstract = {Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides accumulating in the brain are proposed to trigger Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for Abeta42 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for gamma-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in Abeta42, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on gamma-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of gamma-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of Abeta, as well as cell-based and ex vivo assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of Abeta on gamma-secretases. We show that human Abeta42 peptides, but neither murine Abeta42 nor human Abeta17-42 (p3), inhibit gamma-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75, and pan-cadherin. Moreover, Abeta42 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in Abeta42 contribute to cellular toxicity via the gamma-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address Abeta toxicity in the context of gamma-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.},

abstract = {Mutations in the PSEN genes are the major cause of familial Alzheimer's disease, and presenilin (PS) is the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase, which cleaves type I transmembrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to release Abeta peptides. While PS plays an essential role in the protection of neuronal survival, PSEN mutations also increase the ratio of Abeta42/Abeta40. Thus, it remains unresolved whether PSEN mutations cause AD via a loss of its essential function or increases of Abeta42/Abeta40. Here, we test whether the knockin (KI) allele of Psen1 L435F, the most severe FAD mutation located closest to the active site of gamma-secretase, causes age-dependent cortical neurodegeneration independent of Abeta by crossing various Psen mutant mice to the App-null background. We report that removing Abeta completely through APP deficiency has no impact on the age-dependent neurodegeneration in Psen mutant mice, as shown by the absence of effects on the reduced cortical volume and decreases of cortical neurons at the ages of 12 and 18 mo. The L435F KI allele increases Abeta42/Abeta40 in the cerebral cortex while decreasing de novo production and steady-state levels of Abeta42 and Abeta40 in the presence of APP. Furthermore, APP deficiency does not alleviate elevated apoptotic cell death in the cerebral cortex of Psen mutant mice at the ages of 2, 12, and 18 mo, nor does it affect the progressive microgliosis in these mice. Our findings demonstrate that Psen1 mutations cause age-dependent neurodegeneration independent of Abeta, providing further support for a loss-of-function pathogenic mechanism underlying PSEN mutations.},

abstract = {Potent gastric acid suppression using proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is common in clinical practice yet may have important effects on human health that are mediated through changes in the gastrointestinal microbiome. Acting through pH-dependent or pH-independent mechanisms, PPIs have the potential to alter the normal microbiota throughout the human gastrointestinal lumen. In the esophagus, PPIs change the normal bacterial milieu to decrease distal esophageal exposure to inflammatory Gram-negative bacteria which may lower the risk of Barrett's esophagus. In the stomach, PPIs alter the abundance and location of gastric Helicobacter pylori and other bacteria, which has implications for peptic ulcer disease and gastric malignancy. In the small bowel, PPIs cause polymicrobial small bowel bacterial overgrowth and have been associated with the diagnosis of celiac disease. In the colon, PPIs associate with incident but not recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, putatively through alterations in commensal colonic anaerobes. Our understanding of the effect of gastric acid suppression on the human gastrointestinal microbiome is incomplete but is rapidly advancing.},

abstract = {Hydrochloric acid is crucial in gastric physiology. In 1978 cimetidine, the first H2 antagonist of histamine receptors on the gastric parietal cell was introduced into therapy, inducing acid. Lasting the years, several studies focused on the potential relationship between inducing hypo-achlorhydria and risk of developing gastric cancer. In 1988 omeprazole, the first proton pump inhibitor, entered therapy. In 1996, Kuipers underlined the danger of progression of chronic atrophic gastritis in subjects taking PPIs. In 2018, one paper from Korea and an another on from Sweden suggested a possible relationship between long-term PPI therapy and the development of gastric cancer. Over the years, several articles, meta-analyzes and population based focused on relationship between long-term of PPI use and the onset of gastric cancer, with conflicting results. As reported, the presence of bias in the collection of cases, in particular concerning the evaluation of the H.p. status and presence of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia in subjects treated with PPI, can lead to noticeable errors in the results and conclusions, as demonstrated in the literature by exhaustive methodological studies of pharmacoepidemiology. A possible bias in the collection of case histories is due to the fact that PPIs are often administered to dyspeptic patients, among which there are patients already carriers of gastric neoplasia: the so-called inverse causality. Literature data, amended by methodological bias (sampling errors, lack of comparative assessment of Hp status and atrophic gastritis) NOT support a causal relationship between long-term PPIs therapy and the onset of gastric cancer.

abstract = {Proton Pump Inhibitors are used widely to manage many gastric acid-related conditions such as gastroesophageal disease, gastritis, esophagitis, Barretts esophagus, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, peptic ulcer disease, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated ulcers, and Helicobacter pylori eradication, around the globe. This review article focuses on adverse effects associated with the long-term use of proton pump inhibitors. Various observational studies, clinical trials, and meta-analyses have established the adverse effects associated with the long-term use of proton pump inhibitors including renal disorders (acute interstitial nephritis, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease), cardiovascular risks (major adverse cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and stroke), fractures, infections (Clostridium difficile infection, community-acquired pneumonia, and Coronavirus disease 2019), micronutrient deficiencies (hypomagnesemia, anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia), hypergastrinemia, cancers (gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatic cancer), hepatic encephalopathy, and dementia. Clinicians including prescribers and pharmacists should be aware of the adverse effects of taking proton pump inhibitors for an extended period of time. In addition, the patients taking proton pump inhibitors for long-term should be monitored for the listed adverse effects. The American Gastroenterological association recommends a few non-pharmacological measures and the use of histamine 2 blockers to lessen gastrointestinal symptoms of gastroesophageal reflex disease and the utilization of proton pump inhibitors treatment if there is a definitive indication. Additionally, the American Gastroenterological associations Best Practice Advice statements emphasize deprescribing when there is no clear indication for proton pump inhibitors therapy.},

abstract = {Riboflavin, in the presence of Cu(II), caused breakage of calf thymus DNA and supercoiled pBR322 plasmid DNA. The rate of such DNA degradation was several times greater than that caused by riboflavin alone. The reaction was inhibited under anaerobic conditions, but oxygen could be replaced by the addition of H2O2. Riboflavin reduced Cu(II) to Cu(I), which was shown by using the Cu(I)-sequestering reagent neocuproine, to be an essential intermediate in the DNA degradation reaction. Results obtained with scavengers of active oxygen species and their production by riboflavin and Cu(II) indicated that the species predominantly responsible for DNA breakage is singlet oxygen.},

abstract = {Riboflavin is known to generate superoxide anion (O2.-) and other reactive oxygen species in the presence of Cu(II) and light as well as cause fragmentation of DNA and protein in vitro. In the present study we examined the genotoxic effects of photoilluminated riboflavin in the presence of Cu(II). Using the phage inactivation assay, a significant decline in plaque-forming unit (PFU) is seen. Results of Ames testing have suggested that probably a frameshift mutation is caused by a riboflavin-Cu(II)-mediated reaction. Using neocuproine as a Cu(I) sequestering reagent, Cu(I) has been shown to be an essential intermediate generated in the reaction between Cu(II), photoilluminated riboflavin, and DNA. Results obtained with various scavengers of active oxygen species strongly suggest that the species predominantly responsible for DNA damage is oxygen (O2) in the singlet or triplet state, together with H2O2, hydroxyl radical, and hydroxyl ion, to a lesser extent. In the case of riboflavin, a ternary complex of DNA-drug-Cu(II) is presumably formed. A redox reaction, involving riboflavin and Cu(II) in the complex, may then occur with the formation of a DNA-oxidized riboflavin-Cu(I) complex. This probably acts as a catalyst for the oxidation of Cu (I) to Cu(II), during which molecular oxygen is reduced to generate a variety of active oxygen species. The probable mechanism for the generation of these reactive oxygen species has also been proposed.},

abstract = {The Fenton reaction, Fe(H(2)O)(6)(2+) + H(2)O(2) --> Oxidizing product, is of major importance in biology as the major cause of oxidative stress, and in advanced oxidation processes. It is commonly assumed that .OH is the product of the Fenton reaction. The results presented herein point out that .OH is indeed the oxidizing product in acidic solutions for [Fe(H(2)O)(6)(2+)] >[H(2)O(2)]; Fe(IV)(aq) is the active oxidizing product in neutral solutions; in slightly acidic solutions for [H(2)O(2)] >[Fe(H(2)O)(6)(2+)] a mixture of .OH and Fe(IV)(aq) is formed. However CO(3).(-) is the active oxidizing product in neutral solutions containing HCO(3)(-) even at low concentrations, i.e. under physiological conditions. The implications to our understanding of the origins of oxidative stress and of catalytic oxidations in advanced oxidation processes are discussed.},

abstract = {Oxidative stress and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption due to brain endothelial barrier dysfunction contribute to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), which is characterized by beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation in senile plaques. Copper (Cu) is implicated in AD pathology and its levels are tightly controlled by several Cu transport proteins. However, their expression and role in AD, particularly in relation to brain endothelial barrier function remains unclear. In this study, we examined the expression of Cu transport proteins in the brains of AD mouse models as well as their involvement in Abeta42-induced brain endothelial barrier dysfunction. We found that the Cu uptake transporter CTR1 was upregulated, while the Cu exporter ATP7A was downregulated in the hippocampus of AD mouse models and in Abeta42-treated human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs). In the 5xFAD AD mouse model, Cu levels (assessed by ICP-MS) were elevated in the hippocampus. Moreover, in cultured hBMECs, Abeta42-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, ROS-dependent loss in barrier function (measured by transendothelial electrical resistance), and tyrosine phosphorylation of CDH5 were all inhibited by either a membrane permeable Cu chelator or by knocking down CTR1 expression. These findings suggest that dysregulated expression of Cu transport proteins may lead to intracellular Cu accumulation in the AD brain, and that Abeta42 promotes ROS-dependent brain endothelial barrier dysfunction and CDH5 phosphorylation in a CTR1-Cu-dependent manner. Our study uncovers the critical role of Cu transport proteins in oxidative stress-related loss of BBB integrity in AD.},

abstract = {Disrupted systemic copper (Cu) homeostasis underlies neurodegenerative diseases with early symptoms including olfactory dysfunction. This study investigated the impact of Cu dyshomeostasis on olfactory function, adult neurogenesis, and neurochemical balance. Models of Cu deficiency (CuD) and Cu overload (CuO) were established by feeding adult rats with Cu-restricted diets plus ip. injection of a Cu chelator (ammonium tetrathiomolybdate) and excess Cu, respectively. CuD reduced Cu levels in the olfactory bulb (OB), subventricular zone (SVZ), rostral migratory stream (RMS), and striatum, while CuO increased Cu levels in these areas. The buried pellet test revealed both CuD and CuO prolonged the latency to uncover food. CuD increased neural proliferation and stem cells in the SVZ and newly differentiated neurons in the OB, whereas CuO caused opposite alterations, suggesting a switch-type function of Cu in regulating adult neurogenesis. CuO increased GABA in the OB, while both CuD and CuO reduced DOPAC, HVA, 5-HT and the DA turnover rate in olfactory-associated brain regions. Altered mRNA expression of Cu transport and storage proteins in tested brain areas were observed under both conditions. Together, results support an association between systemic Cu dyshomeostasis and olfactory dysfunction. Specifically, altered adult neurogenesis along the SVZ-RMS-OB pathway and neurochemical imbalance could be the factors that may contribute to olfactory dysfunction.},

abstract = {Peroxyacetic acid (PAA), as an oxidizing agent, has gained significant attention in the field of advanced oxidation because of its low toxicity and high degradation capacity. In this study, cobalt-iron-based Prussian blue analogs (Co-PBAs) were utilized for the first time to activate PAA for tetracycline degradation. In the Co-PBAs/PAA system, organic radicals (RO*) and high-valent metal oxides are mainly produced. TC is efficiently removed in a wide pH range (5-9) and a variety of interferences (Cl(-), SO(4)(2-), bicarbonate ions (HCO(3)(-)), humic acid, and the actual water bodies) in water bodies due to the specificity of RO*. Interestingly, the catalytic rate of the Co-PBAs/PAA system was significantly accelerated in the presence of HCO(3)(-) (k(obs) increasing from 0.171min(-1) to 0.534min(-1)). This enhancement is attributed to the reaction between HCO(3)(-) and PAA, and carbonate radicals (*CO(3)(-)) and acetyl peroxyl radicals (CH(3)C(O)OO*) are generated and then react with the phenolic hydroxyl group of TC. In this study, the mechanism of PAA activation by Co-PBAs was revealed, and PAA-based advanced oxidation process enhanced by HCO(3)(-) was provided for the removal of pollutants from wastewater.},

abstract = {Foods that are rich in organosulfides are highly regarded for their broad range of functions in disease prevention and health promotion since ancient time yet modern scientific study, particularly clinical studies could not agree with traditional wisdom. One of the complexities is due to the labile nature of organosulfides, which are often transformed to different structures depending on the processing conditions. The recent evidence on polysulfides as H2S donors may open up a new avenue for establishing structure and health promotion activity relationship. To put this development into perspective, we carried out a review on the recent progress on the chemistry and biochemistry of organopolysulfides with emphasis on their cardioprotective property. First, we briefly surveyed the foods that are rich in polysulfides and their structural diversity. This is followed by in-depth discussion on the chemical transformations of polysulfides under various processing conditions. We further reviewed the potential action mechanisms of polysulfides in cardioprotection through: (a) hydrogen sulfide releasing activity; (b) radical scavenging activity; and (c) activity in enzyme inhibition and intervention of gene regulation pathways. Based on the literature trend, we can conclude that the emerging concept of organopolysulfides as naturally occurring H2S donors is intriguing and warrants further research to establish the structure and activity relationship of the organopolysulfides as H2S donors.},

abstract = {Sulfur is a vital element that all living things require, being a component of proteins and other bio-organic substances. The various kinds and varieties of microbes in nature allow for the transformation of this element. It also should be emphasized that volatile sulfur compounds are typically present in food in trace amounts. Life cannot exist without sulfur, yet it also poses a potential health risk. The colons sulfur metabolism, which is managed by eukaryotic cells, is much better understood than the S metabolism in gastrointestinal bacteria. Numerous additional microbial processes are anticipated to have an impact on the content and availability of sulfated compounds, as well as intestinal S metabolism. Hydrogen sulfide is the sulfur derivative that has attracted the most attention in relation to colonic health, but it is still unclear whether it is beneficial or harmful. Several lines of evidence suggest that sulfate-reducing bacteria or exogenous hydrogen sulfide may be the root cause of intestinal ailments, including inflammatory bowel diseases and colon cancer. Taurine serves a variety of biological and physiological purposes, including roles in inflammation and protection, additionally, low levels of taurine can be found in bodily fluids, and taurine is the primary sulfur component present in muscle tissue (serum and urine). The aim of this scoping review was to compile data from the most pertinent scientific works about S compounds' existence in food and their metabolic processes. The importance of S compounds in various food products and how these compounds can impact metabolic processes are both stressed in this paper.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interleaflet haemorrhage (IH) plays a well-recognized detrimental role in calcified aortic valve disease (CAVD). However, IH-induced fibro-osteogenic responses in valvular interstitial cells (VICs) appear to be triggered under specific pathological conditions. Iron deficiency (ID), a common co-morbidity in CAVD, may influence these responses. This study investigated the relationship between ID and pathological changes associated with CAVD, and its effects on IH-mediated fibro-osteogenic differentiation of VICs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two independent studies were conducted, including 2,495 patients in the discovery study and 34 in the validation study. Our data demonstrated that ID was associated with CAVD severity and progression, particularly in an age-dependent manner. Based on these clinical findings, immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses revealed that TFR1, a key iron import transporter, was significantly upregulated in human calcified aortic valves. Concurrently, iron accumulation was detected by Perl's staining in both calcific and non-calcific valve sections. In vitro, VICs cultured with human serum from ID patients showed red blood cell lysis-induced iron overload and fibro-calcific differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: ID triggers TFR1-mediated intracellular iron overload, leading to fibrosis and calcification in human VICs, thereby contributing to IH-mediated valve remodeling and calcification. These findings supported the potential role of monitoring and correcting ID to slow or prevent the progression of valvular calcification.},

abstract = {Copper (Cu) is an essential trace element in the production of swine. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of 3 different sources of Cu on growth performance, Cu metabolism, and intestinal microorganisms of finishing pigs, so as to estimate the bioavailability of the 3 sources for pigs. A total of 42 male finishing pigs (88.745.74kg) were randomly allocated to 7 treatments. The factors were 3 sources (CuSO4, Cu-glycine, Cu-proteinate) and 2 levels (5 and 20mg/kg) of Cu, plus one negative control treatment (0mg/kg added Cu level) for the entire 28-d experiment. The average daily gain (ADG) and feed to gain ratio (F:G) both increased when Cu was added. The Cu level in liver, bile, kidney, serum, lung, urine and feces rose (P<0.001) with increasing dietary Cu level regardless of the source. Meanwhile, pigs receiving organic Cu (glycinate or proteinate) retained more Cu and excreted less Cu than those receiving inorganic Cu (CuSO4), which showed that organic forms were more bioavailable. At the transcriptional level, changes in the level and source of dietary Cu resulted in modulation of transporters. In the jejunal mucosa, import transporter high affinity copper uptake protein 1 (CTR1) and export transporter ATPase copper transporting alpha (ATP7A) in supplemental Cu treatments were down-regulated compared to the control. Also, peptide transporter 1 (PepT1) and lanine-serine-cysteine transporter, type-2 (ASCT2) were significantly (P<0.01) up-regulated in 20mg/kg Cu-proteinate and Cu-glycinate treatments, respectively. Microbial diversity was lowest in the 20mg/kg CuSO4 treatment, and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes was higher in added Cu treatments, especially Cu-glycinate treatment. These results indicate that uptake of different Cu forms is facilitated by different transporters and transport mechanisms, and compared with inorganic Cu, organic Cu provides benefits to intestinal microflora and reduces Cu excretion.},

abstract = {While in vitro and animal studies of osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity as well as bone resistance for copper are numerous, and the results encouraging in terms of regulation, human studies are scarce. The aim of this narrative review was to investigate the correlation of blood copper, daily copper intake, and copper supplementation with bone mineral density. This review included 10 eligible studies: five studies concerned copper blood levels, one study concerned daily copper intake, and four studies concerned copper supplementation. Blood copper levels did not show statistically significant differences in four of the studies analyzed, while only one study showed differences between osteoporotic and healthy women, although only with women between 45 and 59 years of age and not between 60 and 80 years of age. The dietary copper intake among women with or without osteoporosis did not show any differences. Only one study with a small sample of subjects carried out these assessments; therefore, it is a topic that the literature must deepen with further studies.

abstract = {Metal ions provide considerable functionality across biological systems, and their utilization within biomolecules has adapted through changes in the chemical environment to maintain the activity they facilitate. While ancient earth's atmosphere was rich in iron and manganese and low in oxygen, periods of atmospheric oxygenation significantly altered the availability of certain metal ions, resulting in ion replacement within biomolecules. This adaptation mechanism has given rise to the phenomenon of metal cofactor interchangeability, whereby contemporary proteins and nucleic acids interact with multiple metal ions interchangeably, with different coordinated metals influencing biological activity, stability, and toxic potential. The ability of extant organisms to adapt to fluctuating metal availability remains relevant in a number of crucial biomolecules, including the superoxide dismutases of the antioxidant defense systems and ribonucleotide reductases. These well-studied and ancient enzymes illustrate the potential for metal interchangeability and adaptive utilization. More recently, the ribosome has also been demonstrated to exhibit interchangeable interactions with metal ions with impacts on function, stability, and stress adaptation. Using these and other examples, here we review the biological significance of interchangeable metal ions from a new angle that combines both biochemical and evolutionary viewpoints. The geochemical pressures and chemical properties that underlie biological metal utilization are discussed in the context of their impact on modern disease states and treatments.},

abstract = {Prolonged exposure to interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) and the associated increased expression of the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) create an intracellular shortage of tryptophan in the cancer cells, which stimulates ribosomal frameshifting and tryptophan to phenylalanine (W>F) codon reassignments during protein synthesis. Here, we investigated whether such neoepitopes can be useful targets of adoptive T cell therapy. Immunopeptidomic analyses uncovered hundreds of W>F neoepitopes mainly presented by the HLA-A( *)24:02 allele. We identified a T cell receptor (TCR(TMBIM6W>F.1)) possessing high affinity and specificity toward TMBIM6(W>F)/HLA-A( *)24:02, the inducible W>F neoepitope with the broadest expression across cancer cell lines. TCR(TMBIM6W>F.1) T cells are activated by tryptophan-depleted cancer cells but not by non-cancer cells. Finally, we provide in vivo proof of concept for clinical application, whereby TCR(MART1) T cells promote cancer cell killing by TCR(TMBIM6W>F.1) T cells through the generation of W>F neoepitopes. Thus, neoepitopes arising from W>F substitution present shared and highly expressed immunogenic targets with the potential to overcome current limitations in adoptive T cell therapy.},

abstract = {The absolute conservation of tryptophan at position 59 in cytochrome c is related to the unique chemical nature of its indole moiety. The indole side chain of Trp-59 possesses three salient features: bulk, hydrophobicity and the ability of its indole nitrogen to act as a hydrogen-bond donor. Crystallographic evidence identifies the indole nitrogen of Trp-59 as having a stabilizing hydrogen-bonding interaction with the buried carboxylate group of haem propionate 7. Side-chain bulk is also likely to be important because a Phe or Leu residue can replace Trp to give an at least partly functional protein, whereas the smaller Gly or Ser cannot. Semisynthetic analogues were designed to test the importance of the side-chain features of tryptophan by using a recently developed method for stereoselective fragment religation in yeast cytochrome c. Three yeast iso-1 cytochrome c analogues were produced in which Trp-59 was replaced by a non-coded amino acid: p-iodophenylalanine, beta-(3-pyridyl)-alanine or beta-(2-naphthyl)-alanine. Replacement of Trp-59 with these non-coded amino acids allows the reasons for its conservation to be analysed, because they vary with respect to size, hydrophobicity and hydrogen-bond potential. Our results show that decreasing the bulk and hydrophobicity of the side chain at position 59 has a profound but different impact on physicochemical and biological parameters from those of abolishing hydrogen-bond donor potential. This suggests that Trp-59 has both a local and a global stability effect by solvating a buried charge and by having a key role in the packing of the cytochrome c hydrophobic core.},

abstract = {A single tryptophan (W(334(I))) within the mitochondrial-encoded core subunits of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is selectively oxidized when hydrogen peroxide reacts with the binuclear center. W(334(I)) is converted to hydroxytryptophan as identified by reversed-phase HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry analysis of peptides derived from the three SDS-PAGE purified subunits. Total sequence coverage of subunits I, II and III was limited to 84%, 66% and 54%, respectively. W(334(I)) is located on the surface of CcO at the membrane interface. Two other surface tryptophans within nuclear-encoded subunits, W(48(IV)) and W(19(VIIc)), are also oxidized when hydrogen peroxide reacts with the binuclear center (Musatov et al. (2004) Biochemistry 43, 1003-1009). Two aromatic-rich networks of amino acids were identified that link the binuclear center to the three oxidized tryptophans. We propose the following mechanism to explain these results. Electron transfer through the aromatic networks moves the free radicals generated at the binuclear center to the surface-exposed tryptophans, where they produce hydroxytryptophan.},

abstract = {The essential transition metal copper is important in lipid metabolism, redox balance, iron mobilization and many other critical processes in eukaryotic organisms. Genetic diseases where copper homeostasis is disrupted, including Menkes Disease and Wilson Disease, indicate the importance of copper balance to human health. The severe consequences of insufficient copper supply are illustrated by Menkes Disease, caused by mutation in the X-linked ATP7A gene encoding a protein that transports copper from intestinal epithelia into the bloodstream and across the blood-brain barrier. Inadequate copper supply to the body due to poor diet quality or malabsorption can disrupt several molecular level pathways and processes. Though much of the copper distribution machinery has been described and consequences of disrupted copper handling have been characterized in human disease as well as animal models, physiological consequences of sub-optimal copper due to poor nutrition or malabsorption have not been extensively studied. Recent work indicates that insufficient copper may be important in a number of common diseases including obesity, ischemic heart disease, and metabolic syndrome. Specifically, marginal copper deficiency (CuD) in has been reported as a potential etiologic factor in diseases characterized by disrupted lipid metabolism such as non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease (NAFLD). In this review, we discuss the available data suggesting that a significant portion of the North American population may consume insufficient copper, the potential mechanisms by which CuD may promote lipid biosynthesis, and the interaction between CuD and dietary fructose in the etiology of NAFLD.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial respiratory chain biogenesis is orchestrated by hundreds of assembly factors, many of which are yet to be discovered. Using an integrative approach based on clues from evolutionary history, protein localization and human genetics, we have identified a conserved mitochondrial protein, C1orf31/COA6, and shown its requirement for respiratory complex IV biogenesis in yeast, zebrafish and human cells. A recent next-generation sequencing study reported potential pathogenic mutations within the evolutionarily conserved Cx9CxnCx10C motif of COA6, implicating it in mitochondrial disease biology. Using yeast coa6 cells, we show that conserved residues in the motif, including the residue mutated in a patient with mitochondrial disease, are essential for COA6 function, thus confirming the pathogenicity of the patient mutation. Furthermore, we show that zebrafish embryos with zfcoa6 knockdown display reduced heart rate and cardiac developmental defects, recapitulating the observed pathology in the human mitochondrial disease patient who died of neonatal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The specific requirement of Coa6 for respiratory complex IV biogenesis, its intramitochondrial localization and the presence of the Cx9CxnCx10C motif suggested a role in mitochondrial copper metabolism. In support of this, we show that exogenous copper supplementation completely rescues respiratory and complex IV assembly defects in yeast coa6 cells. Taken together, our results establish an evolutionarily conserved role of Coa6 in complex IV assembly and support a causal role of the COA6 mutation in the human mitochondrial disease patient.},

abstract = {As essential micronutrients, metal ions such as iron, manganese, copper, and zinc, are required for a wide range of physiological processes in the brain. However, an imbalance in metal ions, whether excessive or insufficient, is detrimental and can contribute to neuronal death through oxidative stress, ferroptosis, cuproptosis, cell senescence, or neuroinflammation. These processes have been found to be involved in the pathological mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, the research history and milestone events of studying metal ions, including iron, manganese, copper, and zinc in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinsons disease (PD), Alzheimers disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntingtons disease (HD), will be introduced. Then, the upstream regulators, downstream effector, and crosstalk of mental ions under both physiologic and pathologic conditions will be summarized. Finally, the therapeutic effects of metal ion chelators, such as clioquinol, quercetin, curcumin, coumarin, and their derivatives for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases will be discussed. Additionally, the promising results and limitations observed in clinical trials of these metal ion chelators will also be addressed. This review will not only provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of metal ions in disease development but also offer perspectives on their modulation for the prevention or treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO(3)RR) to ammonia is an attractive approach for mitigating NO(3)(-) pollution and producing valuable NH(3). Cobalt-sulfur compounds are widely considered to be potential electrocatalysts for NO(3)RR. However, there is still a lack of research on the probable structural evolution, long-term stability, and reactive sites of cobalt-based sulfides during catalysis. Herein, we have employed three cobalt sulfides (CoS(x), where x = 8/9, 2, 1.097) with different sulfur contents as catalysts for electrocatalytic NO(3)RR under alkaline conditions. At -0.8 V vs RHE, all these CoS(x) show promising performances that Faradaic efficiencies of >80% and a high yield of >1780 mmol h(-1) g(cat)(-1) for NH(3) production are achieved. Through a combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and other characterizations, it is revealed that all these cobalt sulfides are easily converted into cobalt hydroxide during the NO(3)RR. This phenomenon is seemingly contradictory to the thermodynamic prediction that, according to the Pourbaix diagram, these CoS(x) compounds should be stable even under the catalytic condition. We suggest that this is due to the presence of Cl(-) ions in the electrolyte that promote the transformation of CoS(x) toward Co(OH)(2). Chloride ions are commonly found in both industrial settings and natural water bodies and are challenging to remove. The evolved Co(OH)(2) species is proposed to be responsible for catalyzing NO(3)RR, especially during a long-term catalytic process. This study highlights the inevitable structural evolution of CoS(x) catalysts under current alkaline electrocatalytic NO(3)RR conditions, offering theoretical guidance for the judicious selection and design of future catalysts.},

abstract = {Background: Malnutrition presents a significant challenge in managing patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), yet its impact on AF recurrence after catheter ablation in this population remains unclear. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 204 patients with paroxysmal non-valvular AF and HFpEF who underwent radiofrequency or cryoballoon ablation. Risk of malnutrition as assessed using three screening tools: the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score, Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), and Nutritional Risk Index (NRI)]. We examined the relationship between risk of malnutrition and AF recurrence post-ablation. Results: After a mean follow-up period of 11.2 1.8 months, 43 patients (21.1%) experienced AF recurrence. Despite being classified as overweight or obese based on body mass index, many patients were at risk of malnutrition according to the CONUT score, NRI, and PNI. Adjusted analyses showed that higher CONUT scores (HR: 10.132; 95% CI: 2.54540.336; P = 0.001), lower NRI (HR: 22.734; 95% CI: 6.39980.776; P < 0.001), or lower PNI (HR: 9.469; 95% CI: 3.23227.739; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with increased risk of AF recurrence. Restricted cubic spline regression revealed an inverted U-shaped relationship between the CONUT score and AF recurrence, and L-shaped relationships for both NRI and PNI with AF recurrence. Conclusions: Systematic nutritional assessment is crucial in patients with paroxysmal non-valvular AF and HFpEF. High CONUT scores, low NRI, or low PNI serve as independent predictors for AF recurrence. Further large-scale randomized controlled trials are required to validate these findings.},

abstract = {Divalent copper (Cu(II)) frequently coexists with nitrate (NO(3)(-)) in industrial wastewater and the effect of Cu(II) on the autotrophic denitrification system using H(2) as the electron donor remains unknown. In this study, the hydrogen-based membrane biofilm reactor (H(2)-MBfR) was operated continuously over 150 days to explore the effect of Cu(II) on the performance of autotrophic denitrification system and understand the key roles of EPS and microbial community. More than 95% of 20 mg-N/L NO(3)(-) was removed at 1-5 mg/L Cu(II), and the removal rate of NO(3)(-)-N was stabilized to 82% at 10 mg/L Cu(II) after a short period, while NH(4)(+) and NO(2)(-) in effluent were hardly detected, indicated that high concentration of Cu(II) did not permanently inhibit the denitrification performance in H(2)-MBfR. Colorimetric determination showed that Cu(II) stimulated the secretion of EPS, in which the protein (PN) content was much higher than polysaccharide (PS). The PN/PS ratios increased from 0.93 to 1.99, and the PN was more sensitive to copper invasion. The results of three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix illustrated that tryptophan was the main component of EPS chelating Cu(II) to reduce toxicity. The results of Fourier-transform infrared demonstrated that hydroxyl, carboxyl, and protein amide groups bound and reduced Cu(II). Furthermore, Cu(II) was effectively removed (>80%), and the results of distribution and morphology analysis of Cu(II) show that the electron-dense deposits of monovalent copper (Cu(I)) were found in EPS and biofilms and the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) was an obvious self-defense reaction of biofilm to copper stress. The microbial richness and diversity decreased with the long-term exposure to Cu(II), while the relative abundance of denitrifiers Azospira and Dechloromonas increased. This study provides a scientific basis for the optimal design of treatment system for removal of nitrate and recovery of heavy metals simultaneously.},

abstract = {Copper is an essential micronutrient for most organisms that is required as a cofactor for crucial copper-dependent enzymes encoded by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Evidence accumulated over several decades has shown that copper plays important roles in the function of the mammalian immune system. Copper accumulates at sites of infection, including the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts and in blood and urine, and its antibacterial toxicity is directly leveraged by phagocytic cells to kill pathogens. Copper-deficient animals are more susceptible to infection, whereas those fed copper-rich diets are more resistant. As a result, copper resistance genes are important virulence factors for bacterial pathogens, enabling them to detoxify the copper insult while maintaining copper supply to their essential cuproenzymes. Here, we describe the accumulated evidence for the varied roles of copper in the mammalian response to infections, demonstrating that this metal has numerous direct and indirect effects on immune function. We further illustrate the multifaceted response of pathogenic bacteria to the elevated copper concentrations that they experience when invading the host, describing both conserved and species-specific adaptations to copper toxicity. Together, these observations demonstrate the roles of copper at the hostpathogen interface and illustrate why bacterial copper detoxification systems can be viable targets for the future development of novel antibiotic drug development programs.},

abstract = {Transplanted adipose stem cells (ASC) have a low survival rate in the body, and there are not many ASC that can be effectively used, which weakens their tissue repair function. Based on this status quo, a new type of copperbased metalorganic network (CuMON) was used to pretreat cells to regulate cell activity in order to improve the efficacy of cell therapy or reduce the number of cells used, thus reducing the cost of clinical treatment. Gene expression changes before and after CuMON treatment of normal donor adipose stem cells (NDASC) and type 2 diabetes mellitus adipose stem cells (T2DMASC) were evaluated through RNA sequencing, KEGG and GO enrichment analysis. The results showed that CuMON improved ASC cell quality by regulating immune response and promoting paracrine secretion. IL17 signaling pathway and IL6, CXCL8, and MMP9 were key pathways and necessary genes that affected the ability of stem cells. In addition, CuMON also improved stem cell antiviral ability through Type I interferon signaling pathway. Our research showed that CuMON had improved the cell quality of ASC by regulating immune response, promoting paracrine secretion, and improving antiviral capabilities. This approach to biomaterial pretreatment is fast, convenient, and relatively safe, and provides new strategies for improving the efficiency of cell therapies.},

abstract = {Maintaining an appropriate acidbase equilibrium is crucial for human health. A primary influencer of this equilibrium is diet, as foods are metabolized into non-volatile acids or bases. Dietary acid load (DAL) is a measure of the acid load derived from diet, taking into account both the potential renal acid load (PRAL) from food components like protein, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium, and the organic acids from foods, which are metabolized to bicarbonate and thus have an alkalinizing effect. Current Western diets are characterized by a high DAL, due to large amounts of animal protein and processed foods. A chronic low-grade metabolic acidosis can occur following a Western diet and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Nutritional advice focusing on DAL, rather than macronutrients, is gaining rapid attention as it provides a more holistic approach to managing health. However, current evidence for the role of DAL is mainly associative, and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This review focusses on the role of DAL in multiple conditions such as obesity, cardiovascular health, impaired kidney function, and cancer.},

abstract = {The response of human growth hormone to the oral administration of 5.0 mg copper was studied in plasma from 12 normal adults. Blood samples were collected at 30 min intervals over a period of 240 min after two basal measurements taken at time = -30 and time = 0 min. Six subjects responded to the stimulus with increased growth hormone secretion, revealing a positive correlation with plasma copper levels. The other six subjects presented a similar rise in plasma copper levels but no increase in plasma growth hormone levels. These results suggest that acute, high blood copper levels can increase basal growth hormone secretion in normal individuals, presumably by acting on the hypothalamic center.},

abstract = {Zn is an essential nutrient that is required in humans and animals for many physiological functions, including immune and antioxidant function, growth, and reproduction. The present study evaluated whether Zn deficiency would negatively affect bone-related enzyme, ALP, and other bone-related minerals (Ca, P and Mg) in rats. Thirty Sprague Dawley rats were assigned to one of the three different Zn dietary groups, such as Zn adequate (ZA, 35 mg/kg), pair fed (PF, 35 mg/kg), Zn deficient (ZD, 1 mg/kg) diet, and fed for 10 weeks. Food intake and body weight were measured daily and weekly, respectively. ALP was measured by spectrophotometry and mineral contents were measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrophotometer (ICP-MS). Zn deficient rats showed decreased food intake and body weight compared with Zn adequate rats (p<0.05). Zn deficiency reduced ALP activity in blood (RBC, plasma) and the tissues (liver, kidney and small intestine) (p<0.05). Also, Zn deficiency reduced mineral concentrations in rat tissues (Ca for muscle and liver, and Mg for muscle and liver) (p<0.05). The study results imply the requirement of proper Zn nurture for maintaining bone growth and formation.},

abstract = {Hereditary forms of copper toxicosis exist in man and dogs. In man, Wilson's disease is the best studied disorder of copper overload, resulting from mutations in the gene coding for the copper transporter ATP7B. Forms of copper toxicosis for which no causal gene is known yet are recognized as well, often in young children. Although advances have been made in unraveling the genetic background of disorders of copper metabolism in man, many questions regarding disease mechanisms and copper homeostasis remain unanswered. Genetic studies in the Bedlington terrier, a dog breed affected with copper toxicosis, identified COMMD1, a gene that was previously unknown to be involved in copper metabolism. Besides the Bedlington terrier, a number of other dog breeds suffer from hereditary copper toxicosis and show similar phenotypes to humans with copper storage disorders. Unlike the heterogeneity of most human populations, the genetic structure within a purebred dog population is homogeneous, which is advantageous for unraveling the molecular genetics of complex diseases. This article reviews the work that has been done on the Bedlington terrier, summarizes what was learned from studies into COMMD1 function, describes hereditary copper toxicosis phenotypes in other dog breeds, and discusses the opportunities for genome-wide association studies on copper toxicosis in the dog to contribute to the understanding of mammalian copper metabolism and copper metabolism disorders in man.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cholesterol-fed rabbits have been documented to show increased amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits in the brain that can be exacerbated by the quality of drinking water especially if rabbits drink tap water or distilled water containing copper. One mechanism of cholesterol and Abeta clearance may be through the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Using an ABCA1 antibody, we determined the number of ABCA1-immunopositive neurons in three areas of rabbit brain as a function of feeding 2% cholesterol and providing tap water, distilled water, or distilled water to which aluminum, copper, or zinc was added. RESULTS: The number of neurons with ABCA1 immunoreactivity was increased significantly as a result of dietary cholesterol in the rabbit hippocampus and inferior and superior temporal cortex. The number of neurons with ABCA1 immunoreactivity was further increased in all three areas as a result of cholesterol-fed rabbits drinking tap water or distilled water with copper. Finally, cholesterol-fed rabbits that drank distilled water with aluminum also showed an increased number of ABCA1-immunopositive neurons in inferior and superior temporal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that ABCA1 levels increase in parallel with previously documented increases in Abeta levels as a result of high dietary cholesterol and copper in the drinking water. Addition of aluminum to distilled water may have a similar effect in the temporal cortex. ABCA1 has been proposed as a means of clearing Abeta from the brain and manipulations that increase Abeta also result in an increase of clearance machinery.},

abstract = {With the growth of the elderly people and the development of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) technology, bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs) originating from the decellularized bovine pericardium (DBP) have become a favourable option for severe valvular heart disease (VHD). However, currently, available commercial bioprosthetic heart valves prepared from glutaraldehyde (GA)-crosslinked xenografts have limited durability because of various factors, including severe cytotoxicity, inflammatory response, poor pro-endothelialization ability and calcification. Therefore, the development of valve materials with better performance is urgent. In this work, we first synthesized Cu-doped carbon dots (CuCDs) with excellent biocompatibility and high stability using sodium citrate, ethylenediamine and copper chloride. Subsequently, oxidized chondroitin sulfate (OCS) was used to crosslink the decellularized bovine pericardium to obtain OCS-BP followed by loading CuCDs onto the surface of this OCS-fixed BP sample through amide bonds formed by an EDC/NHS-catalyzed reaction between the functional groups on CuCDs and OCS-BP to prepare the BHV (CuCDs-OCS-BP) with specific properties. Relevant experiments conducted both in vivo and in vitro indicate that CuCDs-OCS-BP with good stability showed improved mechanical properties, compliance and flexibility, encouraging HUVEC-cytocompatibility, excellent anti-blood cell adhesion, antithrombogenic properties, anti-inflammatory and anti-calcification properties, and a good endothelialisation ability due to the catalytic generation of endogenous nitric oxide. Overall, CuCDs-OCS-BP is a promising material for BHVs.},
